﻿It's the end of my second year at TWU, and my second year in Canada;
today was our commencement ceremonies at Abbotsford Pentecostal. Here's
my colleague Eve delivering the commencement address. As usual, we get
all dressed up in our warm floofy regalia and pillowy caps. And just
like last year, I've ended up in the front row, so I can't yawn or
shuffle around. :) It didn't help that our colleagues behind us from the
nursing department kept making these snide remarks; they're so
hilarious!
