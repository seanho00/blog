OK, so this blog entry is my attempt to compensate for \ `the entry
about my gruel </2006/breakfast-gruel>`__ that my sister keeps drawing
attention to. Yes, I can cook a little! Here before you lie the
ingredients to tonight's scrumptious masterpiece -- butterfly pork chops
marinated in honey mustard dressing, softened with a dusting of corn
starch, and sweetened with a teaspoon of Disaronno liqueur. These were
then sautéed in virgin olive oil on high heat until golden brown, after
which the peeled diced BC nectarines on the left were added, together
with a splash of lemon juice. Cover and let simmer on low/med heat for a
few minutes, and it was ready to serve over Thai jasmine rice! Delicious
when paired with a refreshing glass of sweet iced tea. Not too bad, eh?
:)

.... yeah, my audience (me) isn't too discriminating about food ....
