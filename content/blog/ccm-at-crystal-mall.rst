Today we had a planning meeting forÂ \ `CCM's <http://ccmcanada.org/>`__
upcoming youth leadership camp. CCM has a huge office space right in the
middle of Crystal Mall (right behind the food court!), a prime location
to reach many Chinese in the area, and they've got a heart for outreach
and "pre"-evangelism. Allen has been working hard on their youth and
children's ministries, and for this leadership camp we've got 30 teens
and young adults signed up already -- with about a third of them
non-Christians! We're excited for this outreach opportunity.

Most humbling for me at this planning meeting was the realization that
I'm the oldest person there -- and I'm supposed to be the source of wise
counsel! Still, it was so encouraging and humbling to see these young
people, down to grade-11, so gifted and dedicated, enthusiastic and
willing to serve God. Reminds me of youth group when I was their age....
oh dear, I really do sound like an old fogey now, eh?
