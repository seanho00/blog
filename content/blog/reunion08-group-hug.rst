After we all had our afternoon naps and got some good dinner in our
tummies, we're all energetic and happy! Here are b and QQ giving a big
sandwich-hug on top of E. For this reunion, we ended up spending a
significant amount of time simply hanging out in our rooms together,
whichever room happened to be convenient. The room with my parents and I
became the unofficial hang-out, so that if any of the little ones needed
to take a nap (or a time-out!), they could go back to their own rooms.
