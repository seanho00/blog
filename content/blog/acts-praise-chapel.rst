I thoroughly enjoy Trinity's weekly praise chapel every Friday at 11am;
the student-led worship teams are so enthusiastic in leading hundreds of
students in praise. ACTS, the seminaries associated with TWU, has their
own chapel twice weekly, but in my two years here at TWU, I hadn't made
the trek across campus to visit -- until now! Today's ACTS chapel was
special: the CanIL students, led by Daryn, led a wonderful time of
worship, complete with singing, string quartet, and choir anthems. The
atmosphere is so much more intimate, only about 40 people; it was so
refreshing! It was also very cool to chat afterward with all the friends
there from church -- Esther, Jon, Daryn, and Sally. I enjoyed hearing
Sally share about her+Tom's calling to missions. My observation agrees
with hers that the bureaucracy so often quenches rather than encourages
those with a heart to serve. But with or without denominational support,
if God calls, we must go!
