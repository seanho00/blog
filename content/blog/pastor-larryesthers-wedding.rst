Our VCAC youth pastor Larry has been with us for a couple years now and
has a great heart for the teens; he's a real asset to the church
community. I hadn't met Esther before today, but she's been leading
worship at other churches for many years now, and it seems like she
comes from a terrific family. Today we celebrated their wedding in a
wonderful worship service at Fraserlands! I liked how the whole focus
was not so much on Larry+Esther as it was on God and giving glory to Him
for bringing together a devoted couple. Even the music when the bride
walked down the aisle was not the traditional Lohengrin bridal chorus,
but rather the contemporary hymn, "My Tribute" -- "to God be the glory,
for the things He has done"! The exhortation by the bride's father (and
translated entertainingly by her little brother) was really sweet, and I
also thought the foot-washing ceremony was very touching -- yeah, the
whole wedding was really quite moving....
