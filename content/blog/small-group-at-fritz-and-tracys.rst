The BBQ tonight at Fritz+Tracy's place was yummy! It was good to see
everyone again; we hadn't met in four weeks. Unfortunately, I missed
most of the discussion as I had to sneak off to CCM's StokeHouse event
to connect up with Allen there and chat about their upcoming youth
leadership camp. Good people there at CCM -- and I even randomly met
Ken, who is "supposed" to be part of our small group! I made it back to
Fritz+Tracy's just in time for prayer -- and Tony's exquisite desserts
bought from the highest-class, hardest-to-find fine bakeries. Afterward
we chatted at length about church, ministry philosophies, leadership,
etc., until ... oh ... around 2am .... oof, I'm getting too old to stay
up that late! :)
