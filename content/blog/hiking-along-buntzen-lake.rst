This Easter weekend, our small group took a pleasant little outing to
walk the forest trails around Buntzen Lake reservoir, north of Port
Moody. The weather forecast was for rain, and although parts of the
trail were a bit moist, thankfully it didn't rain at all the whole time
we were there! We went as far as we could, about halfway around the
lake, until the trail was completely flooded. A little nice exercise and
some good conversations with friends!
