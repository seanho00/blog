After seeing the CCGC kids off on the bus and cleaning up the campsite a
bit, I was free for the rest of the day, didn't have to give anyone a
ride home. The camp site is way out in Sasquatch Provincial Park, about
15 minutes north of the famous Harrison Hot Springs resort. I'd never
been here before, so I figured I'd cruise around a bit and enjoy the
warm weather. This is Deer Lake, nearby our campground -- that little
beach in centre frame is accessible via a short trail from our
campsites. One of the kids told me that he got up at 5am this morning
and walked down to that beach all by himself -- yipes!

I spent a few more hours at another beach on Harrison Lake, the
Greenspot day area -- munched a packed sandwich, took a nap on driftwood
on the sandy beach, played guitar, and soaked in the sunshine. The drive
home afterward was nice, too -- I had been warned about Highway 1
traffic due to the holiday weekend, so I took the winding and scenic
two-lane Lougheed Highway (Hwy 7), snacking on some delicious fresh BC
cherries. I was awfully tired -- even just from one day with the kids --
but it was a pleasant and relaxing way to spend the holiday!
