Here I am with Mei and the rest of the gang at the cafeteria at Fort
Caswell. hey, their food wasn't half bad -- and I finally got my fix of
authentic southern sweet tea! It was cool to see those college kids
again; they seem so mature and cosmopolitan now! Mei still needs to eat
and sleep better, though, methinks...
