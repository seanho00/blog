As a culmination of the Unite in Worship training conference for worship
leaders, Desperation Band and Starfield had a concert tonight at the
huge sanctuary of Broadway church in Vancouver. It wasn't totally packed
full, but there were still probably close to a thousand folks of all
ages, from teenagers to parents. The concert was fun, and it was nice to
be there with Rob, Phebe, Abby+Neil, Cliff+Libby, and Fritz+Tracy. It
would have been nicer if we had had more of a chance to chat, though! It
was so loud we couldn't really talk with each other much. Starfield was
fantastic -- great music and pretty rockin' -- but I liked the more
worshipful attitude of the Desperation Band folks. Out of the many many
concerts I've been to thus far, I still have to say the best confluence
I've seen of humble worship and musical excellence are the guys
inÂ \ `Common Ground Band <http://cgband.net/>`__; their attitudes are
really inspiring.
