CCM's youth leadership camp at Camp Luther! At four days / three nights,
this camp was longer than most, but even so it still felt like we were
just beginning to break down barriers when we had to say goodbye
already! We had quite a packed schedule, so here everyone is making the
most of the little free time we have until the bus comes at 2pm to take
everyone back to Burnaby. With the scarce sleep that most campers got on
the last night, I'm surprised by all their energy!
