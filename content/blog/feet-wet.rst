Yep, a nice long walk on in the sand is a good way to relax after a
packed Sunday -- and all my Sundays are packed nowadays! We're here at
White Rock beach with the tide mostly out, although the sand is still
wet in most places. I realized later that there's a lesson to be gained,
even from just a low-key Sunday-afternoon stroll.

Traipsing along the muddy flats in our Sunday best, initially we had to
choose our pathway very carefully. My "Sunday best" shoes are the same
shoes I wear everywhere -- one pair of Birkenstocks for all occasions!
Still, rivulets of water would in places isolate the solid ground into
islands -- if we didn't plan our route carefully, we'd end up blocked in
by water, and have to backtrack to find a spot to "ford" the little
streams.

Finally, we gave up and took off our shoes and socks, rolling up our
pant-legs to wade into the water. Oh, the freedom in that first,
decisive step into the mud! There was no going back once our feet were
wet. But with that barrier passed, we were fearless in walking freely
anywhere on the beach -- if anything, it was more comfortable to be in
the water.

It's a bit dangerous, though -- once you go forward, it's a lot harder
to go backward. Walking back to the sidewalk, we had to cross a stretch
of hard pebbles and poky broken shells; that was painful! Life is full
of lessons....
