Ah, sorry my poor blog, you have been neglected for far too long! Well,
the "big news" from the last post to this blog back in 2008 was that I
got engaged! And in the words of one of my friends: "a fianc√©e?! When
did you have a girlfriend?" Yes, it was all very whirlwind-romance, God
swept us both off our feet! The full story is available for those who
are interested, but the short of it is, when God called us, the calling
was very clear -- the only question left was whether we would obey!

So, now that my life is not just one person but two, I have to be
careful about what I post on here! She is very reluctant to have her
photo on the web -- understandably so, given my somewhat high-profile
life! Did I mention the time my dad was in some random town in China and
a young man whom he'd never met before showed him his cellphone -- with
*our* family photo as his wallpaper? Who puts someone *else's* family on
their cellphone?! Soooo spooky....

Well, my DW (dear wifey) and I have been talking about getting this blog
started again, so this is just a welcome back to everyone! The photo and
date of posting are from our wedding day!

Blessings to you all! Stay tuned!
