You know that old stereotype about guys being "goal-oriented" when they
shop -- get in, get the goods, and get out? Yeah, I fit that stereotype
perfectly, especially when it comes to shopping for linens and clothes.
But I really did need new bedsheets, so off I went to WillowBrook mall
on the last day of Boxing Week. Ten minutes later, here I am, mission
accomplished, ready to go home!

Then I remembered I've been wanting a nice long winter overcoat, warmer
than my windbreaker and nicer than my big parka. So I walked around the
mall, visiting every men's clothing store and trying on coats, and
actually just ...Â \ *shopping*. What an odd experience! I spent two
hours there; I was quite proud of myself. The women reading this are
probably rolling their eyes right now, but have patience with me -- I'm
not good at this! I often like to see the whole range first, then pick
the best from what's available. So I poked through the Bay's selection,
then went to a specialty store and tried this really soft 15/85
cashmere/wool formal topcoat. The fabric was so nice, and it was on
sale, too -- for only $695! yipes!

In the end I went next door and bought a fairly standard London Fog
lined trenchcoat for $50. I'm quite happy with it; I'm content!
