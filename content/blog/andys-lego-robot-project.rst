Yep, so today Alma's artificial intelligence class gave their
semester-end presentations, and the project Andy chose was to play with
Legos! Andy's also in my \ `CMPT140 <http://cmpt140.seanho.com/>`__
class; he's very bright and way overqualified for my introductory
course! Here Andy's showing off his \ `Lego
MindStorms <http://mindstorms.lego.com/>`__\ robot, which after it hears
a hand-clap, will fetch the ball and drop it on the other side of a
black line. Pretty cool!
