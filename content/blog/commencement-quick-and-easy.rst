This is now my third time at TWU's commencement convocations, sitting in
the choir loft at Abbotsford Pentecostal, and somehow once again I'm
sitting in the front row, smack in the middle -- so I can't yawn, or
pick my nose, or anything! :)Â Up front is TWU president Dr. Jonathan
Raymond.

Due to space and time limitations, TWU's commencement is always split
into three ceremonies, divided by faculty. Our department of
Mathematical Sciences (including math, computing science, and physics)
doesn't usually see a lot of graduates -- this year, only a couple
computing science, and no math grads (we did have several math grads
last year). But I do get to teach the stats class for nursing, so I got
to see a number of my nursing students graduate.

It's always fun to cheer on students and send them off into the wide
world, wherever God takes them next! Still, today I was rather tired,
and glad just to be done with all the "pomp and circumstance"!
