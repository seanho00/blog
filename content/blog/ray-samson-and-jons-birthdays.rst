How cool, all three of these guys in our small group have birthdays just
one day apart from each other! And this year they're all turning the big
three-oh. So our small group threw them a joint birthday party, a BBQ at
Jon's place in Coquitlam. That mango cake was pretty good, and not too
sweet! We stayed up chatting late into the night; good times. I shall
not be able to look at Caleb's dad again without thinking of oranges and
intimate apparel....
