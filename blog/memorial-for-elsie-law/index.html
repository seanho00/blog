            <p>Today was a somber day for us, but it's a good kind of somber, I think.
Last Sunday one of our dear family friends, Mrs. Elsie Law, flew away to
her Saviour's side. She had been a faithful servant of Christ, devoted
pastor's wife, longsuffering widowed mother of two, a pillar of the
church, and a part of our family for many many years, going back to when
she was a youth counselor and Sunday School teacher for my parents when
they were kids. She was wise, calm, confident, opinionated -- and more
than a little mischievous! My last memory of her is just last year when
I went to visit Seattle: I was kind of lamenting the high expectations
my parents have on a future wife for me, and she patted my hand and
said, "Well, you just tell them that you're the one getting married, not
them, and it's your decision!" Wow, I hadn't expected that!</p>
<p>My dad was asked to share some remembrances on behalf of all her
friends, but he's away in the mainland right now in his ministries, so
my mom shared, and I translated from Mandarin into English. I snuck in
this photo while Elder Hu made some closing statements; there were
probably over 700 people there, but you can't see them from this point
of view from our front-row seats. It was refreshing and comforting to be
back in the company of the church I grew up in, but our time was short
to catch up with old friends, and our conversations were subdued.</p>
<p>Considerably fewer people came to the short graveside service afterward,
but I thought it was beautiful. The weather was just perfect, I thought,
for a funeral -- patches of sun and cloud, windy, with a bit of chill in
the air, the trees bare but the grass still green, and the leaves
blowing around us on the open hillside. Not a day for much laughter or
joking, but a very good day, a day for reflection and thanksgiving.</p>
