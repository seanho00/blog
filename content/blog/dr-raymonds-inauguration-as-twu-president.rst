Today we had a fancy inauguration ceremony for Dr. Jonathan Raymond as
TWU's third president; the ceremony was held at Pacific Academy's rather
posh Pattison Auditorium in Surrey. We all wore our floofy hats and
regalia, but I still wore my trusty Birkenstocks! Honestly, I rather
dislike ceremony and pomp, meh. This snapshot was surreptitiously taken
from my second-row seat on stage with the faculty. Dr. Raymond is up
front in the blue, right hand upheld and left hand on the Bible as he
takes the oath of office. His wife Irene is on his left, and the chair
of the board Allan Hedberg is on his right. The folks in red are from
the Salvation Army band; they did a great job. I was quite impressed
with the conductor: he was so relaxed, it demonstrated a lot of
confidence in the band. Good leadership style!
