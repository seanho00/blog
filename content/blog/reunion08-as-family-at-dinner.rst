Our big outing tonight was to a local Italian family restaurant! We had
originally hoped for a nearby Fuddrucker's, being quite family friendly,
but the address we had led us to an office park, completely closed, no
cars in the lot -- we suspect it was the restaurant chain's corporate
offices! But the Italian restaurant was good, and the wait staff was
quite accommodating of our six very noisy and bouncy kids! Everybody had
a lot of fun with the crayons.
