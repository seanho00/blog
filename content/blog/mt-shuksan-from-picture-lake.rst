Yep, another one of my Sunday after-church random impromptu trips!

I was getting a little frustrated after lunch, had a lot of stuff on my
mind, so I just took a drive to cool my head... I ended up out in
Abbotsford, so I figured, hey, it can't be that much further to Mt.
Baker, eh? So now here I am on the slopes of Mt. Baker, at this very
famous photo spot at Picture Lake, looking across to the 9131-ft peak of
Mt. Shuksan, still snow-laden in the mist of summer. After the other
tourists left, I stayed a couple hours waiting for the evening light to
get good; it was so peaceful! The mirror-still lake, and the little
alpine trees, and the birds, and the zillions of flies and mosquitoes...

A number of people lately have been talking with me about our church's
organization, the small-group model vs. fellowship model, and the LIGHT
young-adults ministry in particular. I think I'm starting to see a bit
of the tension and give-and-take between the capable and independent but
young and transient young adults, and the parental figure of the "old
guard" and church upper leadership. The leadership seems to be very
cautious and conservative, but also top-down and hierarchical. On the
other hand, a lot of the young adults are rather commitment-shy, and
there is a dangerous "commodity" attitude towards church -- if you don't
like one church, you can just go down the road to another one. At least,
those are my observations, but I don't know; I still have a lot more to
learn about this church. Seems you can't escape politics wherever you
go...
