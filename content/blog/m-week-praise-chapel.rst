Yay, praise chapel! TWU has a half-hour voluntary chapel every day, with
guest speakers and such, but every Friday the whole half-hour is for
songs of praise to our Creator. Here we are singing the classic,Â \ `"Be
the Centre" <http://songs.seanho.com/be_the_centre.html>`__. The
PowerPoint is pretty with the background images of sailboats! This week
was Missions Week, culminating in MissionsFest over the weekend in town
at Canada Place. TWU is quite heavily involved with MissionsFest --
faculty seminar speakers, our choir folks Wes+Kim Janzen and the TWU
choirs, and several student-led worship teams, including one in which a
student of mine plays djembe.
