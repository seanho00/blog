            <p>Well, this was really weird! I'm at the Save-On Foods grocery store just
a block away from my house, stocking up on my supply of iced tea, and
I'm waiting in line at the check-out. It's really crowded and busy
today, and the lines are moving slowly. I'm almost to the front of the
line; the cashier is doing her best but looks really tired and
over-worked.</p>
<p>Then, out of the blue, I get this clear, powerful prompting to pray for
this cashier. Her name tag reads, "Sharon": she looks to be in her upper
thirties, heavy-set, her eyes, shoulders, posture, all drooping. She
looks frustrated, drained. I try to ignore the prompting within me, but
it is unmistakable: I need to be praying for this lady, right now.</p>
<p>OK, God, sure I can always pray for the people around me, but do I have
to <em>talk</em> to her about it? Can't I just pray <em>silently</em>? I struggle
and hesitate, and in those 20 seconds she's already finished scanning
and is waiting for me to sign the credit card slip. OK, here I go. As I
sign the slip and push it back, I stammer,</p>
<p>"Ca.. can I pray for you?"</p>
<p>Both she and the bag-boy stop and give me a look that says so
clearly, <em>"What are you, a fool?"</em></p>
<p>I try again: "Would it be all right if I prayed for you?"</p>
<p>She annoyedly replies, "I'm busy here!", waving her hands at the
groceries piling up before her. The bag-boy looks away. I nod and
hastily gather up my things, thinking to myself, "well, duh, that's the
response any <em>sane</em> person would have in this situation!".</p>
<p>Outside in the parking lot, in the beautiful sunshine and cool breeze, I
stop and pray: What just happened here? What was the point of that? I
failed actually to pray with her -- so Lord, why did you nudge me like
that? Lord Jesus, I pray for Sharon. Grant her an extra measure of your
comfort and peace, that she would be able to find joy even in a trying
job; that she would be able to enjoy a bit of the sunshine today, even
if only a glimpse through the store windows. I pray that through one
means or another, she would hear of and know that there is a God in
heaven, the Saviour Jesus Christ, who loves her and wants to redeem her.</p>
<p>And as for me, I am reminded that God is working in the lives of the
people all around me every day, whether I'm aware of it or not -- so I
need to be prepared, I need to open up my eyes and my heart, I need to
keep in step with the Spirit, bearing its fruit in my character:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;search=Gal5:25">(Galatians
5:25)</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The soundtrack that's been running through my head this week is <a class="reference external" href="http://songs.seanho.com/everything.html">Tim
Hughes' "Everything"</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://songs.seanho.com/mp3/everything.mp3">(mp3)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">God in my living, there in my breathing,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">God in my waking, God in my sleeping;</div>
<div class="line">God in my resting, there in my working,</div>
<div class="line">God in my thinking, God in my speaking,</div>
<div class="line">Be my everything, be my everything</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I must glorify God and bear witness to Him in everything I do -- when
I'm grocery shopping, when I'm driving in rush-hour traffic, when I'm
eating lunch with friends after church. The heavens tell of the glory of
God; the whole earth is the cathedral for His worship -- and I will
praise Him in it!</p>
