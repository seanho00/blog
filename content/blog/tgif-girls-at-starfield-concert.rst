Last month our Friday night fellowship `had planned to
attend </2008/dinner-in-lieu-of-starfield-concert>`__ the Christian
music band Starfield's concert at Willingdon Church, but it got
postponed due to an accident the night before. Finally, tonight
Starfield came back for the make-up concert!

The concert was great -- and all the better once I rolled up bits of
tissue paper to use as makeshift ear-plugs! :) I'm serious, I really
enjoy these concerts a lot more when my ears don't hurt.... The kids
still squeezed in tight up front at the foot of the stage, but the band
was very clear, "NO JUMPING".... :)

It was hilarious, when the lead singer came out at the start of the
evening, he was clearly quite surprised at how much of the audience was
Asian -- probably over 60%! Yay for Chinese Christians! With all the
churches that I have opportunity to serve in, I knew a gazillion people
there, and nearly spent more time catching up with old friends before
and after the concert than I spent actually listening to the concert!

Kevin was also there, but up front serving as a bouncer/security for the
stage -- he looked ubercool in his black short-sleeve T-shirt, showing
off his biceps! And here in this photo are our girls, Sunny, Steph,
Ingrid, and Claire!
