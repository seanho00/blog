Happy Thanksgiving, all!

So, this is officially our first Thanksgiving dinner at home with just
the two of us!  Last year was our first Thanksgiving as a married
couple, but we spent the long weekend on a little road trip -- we did
have turkey, but that year it was store-bought from the nearby Safeway.
 This year, my dear wifey has industriously prepared this lovely 8-lb
turkey all by herself -- stuffed with celery, carrots, onions, and bay
leaves for flavour -- carefully basted, and cooked to perfection!

In front we've got steamed corn-on-the-cob, baked sweet-potato
home-fries, her new fresh-from-scratch cranberry/peach sauce, and two
(store-bought) rolls.  Behind the turkey are some fresh salad greens in
a nifty stoneware bowl that she recently picked up, of Peruvian design
(ah, but still made in China!).

Oh, and in the back on our little glass-top dining table, that's my
addition -- my little gardenia plant, I'm so proud that it survived the
summer!

*Postscript:* Dear Wifey wishes me to add her Thanksgiving leftover tip:
she made use of the leftover cranberry sauce and some fresh lemon zest
to make lemon-cranberry muffins -- no food wasted here!
