My colleague Holly organized a conference on Christianity and literature
("Through a Glass Darkly: Suffering, the Sacred, and the Sublime"), and
tonight they took an expedition out to UBC's Chan Centre to see the
Vancouver Symphony. I didn't attend the conference, but I'm always up
for the VSO, and the company was enjoyable, chatting with literary
academics who know their stuff and appreciate good music. :)Â Tonight was
special -- all six Brandenburg concertos in one sitting! The setting was
intimate, more chamber than orchestral, and highlighted the elegant
"conversation in counterpoint" of Bach. Even the musicians' attire
reflected this: rather than the traditional all-black uniform, each
member had a shirt or blouse of a different bright colour. Bach's
effortless fluid motion from one instrument to another paints a
beautiful picture of teamwork -- each member is unique, not a
replaceable automaton, but they work together to lift each other up.
