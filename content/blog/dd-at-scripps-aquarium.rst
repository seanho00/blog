Today we took a little expedition out to the Birch Aquarium at Scripps,
part of UCSD at the beautiful La Jolla Cove. The aquarium is not large,
but is a great way for the university to reach out to the local
community. A favorite with the kids is this set of water tanks, where a
pump constantly circulates a flow of water. Movable plastic dividers
allow one to channel the water and float little toy boats. Lots of fun
and learning about fluid dynamics!
