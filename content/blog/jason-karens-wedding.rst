Yay, our very own cutest couple ever, Jason+Karen, are getting married!
This is our first wedding in our TGIF youth/young-adults' fellowship,
and I believe the second wedding for our church in this church building.
Jason and Karen are such a terrific couple together; they are both
stable and mature Christians, and super-cute together! They had their
fair share of trials while planning for the wedding, but by God's grace
they came through together, Jason and his "Special-K"! (or, as he called
her during wedding preparations, KIC -- "Karen In Charge"!)

The sanctuary at SCAC is also gorgeous for a wedding, with all the
lovely stone granite flooring and stately columns, lavish chandeliers
and abundant flowers -- it's like this every Sunday; it hardly needs to
be decorated for a wedding!
