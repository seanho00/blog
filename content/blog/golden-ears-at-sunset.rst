Well, I never thought "seasonal affective disorder" would affect me -- I
always liked the gentle drizzle and soft grey light that we get here in
the Pacific NW -- but this past week I've been cooped up indoors and
kinda bummed out a bit. So when I saw some golden sunlight and brilliant
blue skies today, I set my mind to go out and enjoy it! There are so
many photo opportunities right here around Langley, so I didn't need to
go far, just up to nearby Fort Langley on the banks of the Fraser River.
Up a small bluff I found this quiet horse farm; everything here was so
still and peaceful. Now if only those horses would pause to lift their
heads for me!

--------------

Prayer meeting tonight was quite surprising, in a good way. The theme
was "thanksgiving sharing", and since we only had about 15 people,
everyone around the circle got about 5 minutes to share what they're
thankful to God for from 2006, and to pray. It was amazing: every one of
us shared some very personal and honest testimonies, struggles that God
has brought us through this year. No Sunday façades here! I was so happy
to see that! It seems like prayer meeting is finally starting to become
its own open community/fellowship, rather than yet another spectacle for
people to drop in on anonymously. One of our popular Willow-Creek
catchphrases is "authenticity", and we often equate it with small
groups. But I think tonight was a good illustration that authenticity
can and ought to extend beyond the small group!
