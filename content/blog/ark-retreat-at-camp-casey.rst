My dear friends at Ark fellowship in Seattle, from my home church there,
ECC, graciously invited me down for the weekend to speak at their
retreat! Ark fellowship is a bilingual (sometimes tri-lingual) young
career / couples group renown for their close bonding and incredible
food! There are folks from all over -- Taiwan, China, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines -- but they find unity in Christ as
they travel through life together. Hence feeling like they're on Noah's
Ark! :)

The retreat was held at cozy Camp Casey on beautiful Whidbey Island,
surrounded by water and greenery. The snow-capped Olympic Mountains lie
just across the water, and in the early morning, the sunrise lights them
aflame. In early April, it's still fairly cold and windy, but thankfully
it didn't really rain this weekend!

We had a wonderful time together; the size was just perfect, so that we
all could fit into two cabins, and even during the free time, most of us
stuck together in one big group. The food was just amazing, better than
I usually eat at home! We had a full layout of rice porridge for
breakfasts, two- and three-course meals, and the last evening we even
had hotpot, with four butane burners! That banner you see in the photo
is filled with messages of encouragement we all wrote to one another; we
had a "Secret Santa" kind of thing, called "小天使" -- Little Angel!

Our retreat theme was a "Dog in Sheep's Clothing" -- ah, it's a long
story.... Anyway, the challenge was to grow as a fellowship -- "stuck
together" (thinking, yoke, training, serving), and living the "CHIME"
(come close to God, hold fast the profession, impact one another, meet
together, encourage). On the last night, we even commemorated Holy
Communion together -- that was special; it was the first time I've led
communion for others!

The retreat came to a close too quickly, but the relationships built up
in Christ will last forever! 'Til next time!
