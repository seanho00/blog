From what I hear we didn't get a white Christmas, but we're getting our
white winter wonderland now! The past week or two, temperatures have
hovered right at or below freezing, with a lot of moisture -- so either
we get a bunch of snow, or a bunch of rain, or something in-between!
Last night was foggy and freezing -- perfect conditions for black ice!

A minute ago, snow was falling quite thickly, although it's tapering off
now. It's so peaceful outside, as the snow traps echoes and stills the
landscape. And here in its midst, I feel my Heavenly Father trap and
still my own heart. The snow-laden boughs are so pretty on this quiet
stand of trees just outside my building on TWU campus; it's just a few
steps from my office. It would be lovely just to sit in silence and
watch as woods fill up with snow:

    | The only other sound's the sweep
    |  Of easy wind and downy flake.

But alas, the "real world" beckons; I need to head back in. Miles to go
before I sleep.
