CCM's youth leadership camp at Camp Luther! Whoo, what a \ *precious*
group of young servant-leaders! May God's grace and strength be upon
them as they strive to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly
with our God. Looking forward to seeing them again at the camp reunion
next Saturday! OK, here's my best attempt at getting everyone's name;
correct me if I messed it up!
