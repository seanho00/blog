            <p>The following is copied from an email I just sent a friend in regard to
ministry at church. My thoughts are still formulating and aren't set in
stone yet, just some ponderings. Oh, and the photo is just a random
one <a class="reference external" href="http://photo.seanho.com/2003-03_Arboretum/">from an old
album</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi , thanks for thinking of me. This email will be a very long
answer to a very short question. :)</p>
<p>Hmm, I do enjoy worshipping God and am thankful for every
opportunity to lead worship. I am always happy to help. And I don't
want to discourage you or anyone else from serving.</p>
<p>However, I personally am somewhat wary of "applying", volunteering
for something (particularly a leadership position) that nobody has
asked me to do. It puts the incumbent ministry leadership in the
awkward position of evaluating ("auditioning") me to see whether I'm
qualified for leadership, whether my motives are pure, and it puts
me in the awkward position of having to "prove" myself to them.
Having been on both sides of that table, I can say that neither
position is comfortable. And I am really tired of having my motives
questioned.</p>
<p>What has worked in the past for me, and continues to work well for
me, is to make myself available for invitations. I am always happy
to help in any ministry in any capacity, when asked. If nobody asks
me, that's quite all right -- I don't need to be in leadership here,
and there are plenty of other ways to serve God, with or without
"official" sanction by the church. It is a very different definition
of a "servant's heart" from what we see in many parts of the church.</p>
<p>My philosophy of church ministry is that if I am in a position of
leadership in a ministry, then God is revealing His vision for this
ministry to me, so I am self-motivated to share this vision, and I
proactively "head-hunt" --</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>go into the pools of potential helpers,</li>
<li>get to know people and their giftings,</li>
<li>share the vision with them, and</li>
<li>individually ask if they would prayerfully consider joining our
team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those with the vision initiate.</p>
<p>In asking people individually, I am indicating that I know and trust
them, and I am implicitly committing to mentor/train them, sharing
in the responsibility. If they mess up, if they feel underqualified,
if people question their motives or spiritual maturity, I will stand
in their corner and defend them.</p>
<p>What I've also found is that people respond really well to this
approach! Saying, "I know you, I trust you, would you consider
joining us?" works so much better than posting a sign-up sheet in
the foyer, then sitting back and complaining that nobody signs up,
or guilt-tripping people into helping. But it does take effort to
proactively get to know people, and so often when we are in
leadership we spend so much time <em>doing</em> things, and we don't
allocate time for <em>relating</em> to people, especially to those
outside of our ministry.</p>
