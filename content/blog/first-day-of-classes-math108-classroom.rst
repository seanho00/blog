Summer is officially over for us, and the new semester has come upon us
so quickly; I am really under-prepared for it! I'm still recuperating
from all the retreats this summer -- seven so far, with one more to go
this coming weekend. And of course, so few of those are really
"retreats" for me, more like working camps! I think I've been
chronically sleep-deprived all summer, and right on the threshold of
getting sick. My mom observes that if I am seriously under-slept for
three days in a row, I get sick -- that's just one of those
peculiarities of my body.

I'm excited to be teaching our MATH108 class again -- this is our
introductory statistics class for nursing students. The nursing students
are always so well motivated, eager to learn, and sweet; they are a joy
to teach. But this is theÂ \ *only* math class they will ever take in
university, so I have my work cut out for me! This is our classroom; it
was recently renovated over the summer with new chalkboards and an LCD
projector (finally!) and sound system. Unfortunately, it was also
reduced in size -- we have to squeeze 45 MATH108 students in here!
