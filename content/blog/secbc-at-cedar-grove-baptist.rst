`Evangelical Chinese Bible Church <http://ecbc.org/>`__ is a large,
mostly Mandarin-speaking, church in south Burnaby. There actually is
some age-old history between ECBC and my hometown church, ECC -- and
some of the politics is a bit sticky. Nevertheless, God has richly
blessed ECBC, and it's probably got the largest Taiwanese population
amongst churches in the Lower Mainland.

ECBC planted a small congregation in Surrey about ten years ago; this
branch runs about 100 people total -- adults, teens, children. It's got
a lovely small-church atmosphere, with lots of young families! They meet
Sunday afternoons here at Cedar Grove Baptist in Surrey; it's been a
tremendous blessing to have these spacious facilities. I've had a
relationship with this church for about a year now, speaking in their
Friday night teens' fellowship on science and the Bible, and again at
their church summer retreat. It's such a privilege and a joy to work
with the kids here!

At their request, now I get to teach the teens' baptismal class every
Sunday afternoon for the next three months, and although it does mean my
Sundays are rather full now, but it is so rewarding to be setting the
groundwork with these kids, establishing the basics of what it means to
be a Christian. The older I get, the more I see how easily even
well-meaning old-time Christians can wander astray, and the more I see
how important it is to lay a solid foundation at an early age!
