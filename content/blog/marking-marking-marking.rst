Oof, well the good news is that the students are done with finals, yay!
And now we have 96 hours to finish all our marking and record final
grades. I am so far behind on marking right now....

It has been quite cool, though, to chat with the students that are
graduating -- to hear them reflect on their years at Trinity, and to see
where God is taking them next. It's such a privilege to have even a
small part in propelling them forward into the world equipped to use
their God-given gifts to serve others and bring glory to the Creator who
gave them their gifts.
