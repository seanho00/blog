Poor Di-di spent most of the reunion with a flu, feeling very sad and
miserable and pathetic, awww.... His nose was running constantly, and he
couldn't breathe well at all, which meant he wasn't sleeping well, which
meant no one else in his room slept well, either! But he did get on the
up-slope toward the end, and in no time at all was back to his usual
talkative self. I think he might have passed it on to the others,
though! Here he's getting a big hug from his big sister as we pack up to
go to the airport. Yes, they're all going back together! Still, one can
never have too many hugs!
