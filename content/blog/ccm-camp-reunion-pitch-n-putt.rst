Our CCM youth leadership camp only just finished last Monday, and
already we miss each other! Allen very conscientiously scheduled a "camp
reunion" post-rally for today -- a chance for us to rekindle new
friendships made at camp, and to segue the commitments made at camp back
into daily life.

Today we had a nice little lunch (Crystal Mall food-court food!), a tiny
birthday cake for Aaron, and then spent a few hours at the nearby
pitch-n-putt at Central Park. We're all beginners at golf, so we could
all equally laugh at each other and ourselves!
