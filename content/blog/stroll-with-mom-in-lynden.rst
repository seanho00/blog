In recent weekdays both my mom and I have been pretty much cooped up
indoors, sweltering in the heat, recuperating from weekend camps/trips,
and working busily on the computer. I just got my mom a new Acer Aspire
One "netbook" mini-laptop -- she really likes the bright screen and tiny
form-factor, but OpenOffice 3 is giving her trouble with her Chinese
presentations. Anyhow, we needed to go south of the border to do some
mail and banking, so today we decided to make that our "big trip"
outing. The weather was bright and sunny, and the boulevard down central
Lynden was bursting with colour and flowers for the county fair. After
doing our errands, we had a nice big ice-cream waffle-cone at a small
shop next door to the post office, right here at this picture.
