The next few blog entries will be a series taken from the 1800 photos I
took over my 9-day trip out to Boston to see my family! Our family
reunions are big and complicated to organize now, with six little ones
and several cross-continent flights to book. This year, it was such a
treat to see the nieces and nephews big enough to play well together --
E and QQ, the two eldest, would spend hours and hours locked up in their
room playing together!

Today's entry is the first day of my trip -- unfortunately, to go
eastward across the country, I have to spend pretty much a whole day
flying: six hours total flying time, plus a couple hours' layover, plus
three hours' timezone difference. Here I am at my stopover in Denver,
chilling out at the posh Red Carpet Club -- my dad had plenty of miles
to upgrade me to international First Class!
