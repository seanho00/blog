Well, with the end of summer and the arrival of fall here in the Lower
Mainland, I was fully expecting to hunker down for six months of wet and
grey without the sun. It's such a pleasant surprise to see bright blue
skies! It's still getting chilly out, and the late evenings and early
mornings out here cover the valley with a soft blanket of pillowy fog. I
snapped this shot on my way to chapel, walking through the central
courtyard on campus.

The walk to and from chapel is a good chance to get out of the office!
After long hours marking, my shoulders and trapezius muscles are getting
kinda strained. Need to work on my posture! Last night was a long night
in the office, staying until around 11:30 marking statistics midterms;
that's no good on the back, either....
