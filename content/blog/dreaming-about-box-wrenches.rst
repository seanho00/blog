OK, so last night I had the oddest dream: I was in a big auto parts
store like MOPAC, shortly before closing time, browsing the shelves. I
spent a long time looking at their open/closed wrench sets (like this
one I got from Home Depot) and a bunch of headgaskets, but I didn't
quite know what I wanted to buy. I stayed past closing, and they started
turning out the lights as a hint to leave, but when I got to the
checkout line, I felt bad because the only thing I'd gotten was a bundle
of zip-ties for $2.95. I had planned on paying with a couple toonies
(CAD$2 coins for you U.S. folk), but the cashier started giving me a
bunch of change like I was giving her a $50, so I had to give her a $50.
There were a lot of other people checking out, and as I was shuffling
all the bills back into my wallet, this tall guy next to me kept bumping
up against me. It made me a bit nervous, like he was going to pickpocket
me or somesuch. Anyway, I got out of there okay, and then I woke up from
my dream!

Dunno what all that says about me, maybe something about my
indecisiveness, or maybe just that I spend too much time working on my
car! At the least, it shows that I've been in Canada long enough to
start dreaming in Canadian currency...
