Ha ha, that was fun! On my way home from work, I saw the sun round and
amber over the fields next to Glover Road, just gorgeous, and I knew I
had to capture a shot of that sunset with a 300mm telephoto lens. As I
was pulling into the garage, the sun was already sinking behind the
neighbouring hills of Surrey; as I grabbed my camera and lens and dashed
out to the balcony, there were less than 90 seconds left to pick a
composition and focus, before the sun disappeared out of sight. After a
tiring Monday catching up on marking and lecture preparation, that was a
fun diversion!
