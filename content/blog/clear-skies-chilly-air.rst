ï»¿Brrrr, it's getting chilly out here! We had a wonderful long summer
this year, but it has definitely drawn to a close. The past few days
have been clear, bright, and beautiful, but cold! The high today was
just barely 5C. A number of my students have been getting sick from the
sudden drop in temperature. Here's a view of Trinity Lake at the
entrance of TWU: the gatehouse is visible on the right; Glover Road
would be on the left off-frame. Highway 1 is behind those trees. This
view is just a 30-second walk from my office.
