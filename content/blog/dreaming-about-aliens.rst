Aliens have taken over Earth! Or so it was in my dream last night, at
any rate. :) I've been having some weird dreams lately, mostly little
vignettes that I can't remember well; I think it's because I've been so
busy and had so much on my mind that I don't rest very well and pop in
and out of REM sleep. No, I don't really believe that God has literally
spoken to me through dreams (not that He couldn't, but He has more
effective ways), but sometimes I do think my dreams reflect what I've
been subconsciously thinking about.

This morning I woke up around 5am from a really clear dream, so I
immediately typed up as much as I could remember of it, before it all
faded away. I used to do this sometimes on paper journals; typing on the
laptop is much faster. I post it here in unedited honesty -- I think it
does indicate some things I'm wrestling with!

(oh, and the photo above is from \ `a trip to Seattle a couple years
ago <http://photo.seanho.com/2006-04_Seattle_EKC_FUN/1d-26911>`__; I
thought it might be a good illustration to accompany the dream.)

    Earth has been taken over by aliens! They can take form to look and
    talk like people, and we are not totally sure if they're friendly or
    not; it's kind of like a benevolent dictatorship. Their technology
    is unfathomably beyond ours; there's no contest and no resistance. I
    and others I know are being rounded up; we're in a bus or something
    similar, in a major metropolitan area (Seattle?). It's cold but
    sunny outside as we pass the waterfront and see the sparkling modern
    buildings, reshaped and transformed somehow by alien technology....

    As we pass a huge ice rink, two colours are playing; one is the
    Calgary Flames. Somebody on the bus comments, "Flames suck!" :) ....
    The general feeling is that the aliens don't want us to be unduly
    alarmed; life can still go on -- but they are definitely in control.

    We're rounded up into a giant stadium, packed with maybe 20,000
    people, maybe 200,000; I don't know. Human-form aliens are scattered
    amongst us, almost 1:1; they can talk with us and are generally
    friendly but a bit quiet. I still have this overriding anxiety about
    what's going on -- what do they want, what will happen to us -- but
    the aliens are efficient and in control: they have a plan, and they
    know what they're doing.... If they had wanted to kill us, they
    could easily have done so already, so maybe they really are
    friendly.

    The alien sitting next to me is a girl; I'm with others I know and
    they seem to accept her readily. She's pretty and soft-spoken and
    doesn't seem to have much of a personal agenda when she talks with
    us -- if they have a nefarious hidden-agenda, she doesn't know it,
    and she's just following what is the accepted track.

    I'm now wearing some sort of big, loose jacket, with a separable
    lining; it doesn't fit well and might be upside-down. There are a
    couple rows of snap-buttons to button it up, but the buttons
    protrude about 2in instead of the usual half-a-cm -- shaped like a
    metal cylindrical dowel, about a cm in diameter. Female end of the
    button is about the same as normal. There's some kind of magnetic
    locking, so that the tip of the dowel snaps in. \ *[ definitely
    inspired by my trenchcoat's buttons in real life ]* The
    buttons/dowels don't line up with the female ends in number or
    position. It was designed by the aliens for us. I'm waiting a bit to
    see what will happen; some announcements are being made but I'm not
    listening closely; they seem to be just general pleasantries. I'm
    snapping and unsnapping the buttons/dowels on my jacket. \ *[ as I
    do in real life when I fidget! ]*

    The alien girl, though quiet, seems to have chosen or connected with
    me, and she seems reasonable enough. She's my new companion
    escorting me into this new world. I'm with other (humans) I know,
    but only a few of us amongst this huge crowd, and I'm not sure
    what's happened to everyone else I know. So although I'd be sad to
    leave them if I had to, if this girl will be the one to help me
    adjust to the new order, then I'd better get to know her. She tells
    me to snap one of the top button/dowels into a particular snap on my
    jacket. I do.

    The crowd is starting to get up; the orientation ceremony is over
    and we're moving on to the next phase (whatever that is).
    Official-looking aliens are coming through the crowd rounding up
    people and aliens. (Note that all the aliens look and act completely
    human and speak intelligibly to us.) The alien girl next to me gets
    a bit nervous. I get the feeling that having me put the dowel in a
    particular snap means something important and will cost her
    something: she is making some kind of commitment to me. I think it
    also means I have made some kind of commitment to her, but I'm not
    sure what.

    An alien official comes around to me and notices my dowel on my
    jacket. He asks both me and her, "You understand what this means,
    right? You're sure about this?". Yipes, no, I don't know what it
    means! But she's nice, and if as I suspect the alternative is to be
    killed or put in a concentration camp or cast out of society, I'd be
    okay with being with her.... I look at her anxiously, but she
    reassures me, "it just means you'll be brought into our society".
    Okay, I still don't know what that means; their society could mean
    almost anything -- I picture in my mind being plugged into some
    Matrix-style pods, my body used for energy harvesting, or being her
    house-servant for life, or something ... of course, I wouldn't mind
    living as her servant in this clean and technologically-advanced
    society, and again she seems nice.

    The official is getting impatient; he expects an answer. The dowel
    is in the snap. My girl is looking expectantly but nervously at me.
    I realize that this is costing her as much as it will cost me. OK,
    I'll go for it.

And that's when I woke up! :) Well, I'll leave it to you to make your
own Freudian interpretation -- who are the aliens in my life!
