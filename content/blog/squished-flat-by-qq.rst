I was super-super tired on the flight down -- I've been desperately low
on sleep for the past two months, and these few days I have to scramble
like mad to mark a ton of papers and exams. I even had to bring some of
the marking with me -- about half the weight in my bag is papers! A
"working vacation", as my brother-in-law puts it; I have 48 hours left
to submit final grades online.

But of course, the moment I arrive at their home, all of that gets put
on the back-burner when I get to play with the kids! When Qing-qing was
smaller, she complained that her overly-affectionate older cousin Elise
would squish her flat ("﻿ya bian-bian") with her bear-hugs. Now that
QQ's a bit older, she's passing on the legacy by squishing her little
brother and squishing me! :) DD, meanwhile, just \ *loves* his toy cars,
of which he's got approximately two gazillion -- and even that's not
enough!
