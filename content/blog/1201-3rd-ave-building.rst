ï»¿Ever since I was small I've always liked the architecture of the
Washington Mutual building at 1201 3rd Ave in downtown Seattle -- the
glass and concrete, squares and circles, old-style elegance and
contemporary sleekness. But I never had a chance to actually go inside,
until today! It's just as nice inside, with lots of white marble and
light wood paneling.
