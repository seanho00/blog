For our small group activity today, Jon+Rosanna, Samson, Adam and I went
for a "leisurely" 8km walk/hike around Burnaby Mountain at SFU campus.
Some of those trails are pretty steep; "Cardiac Trail" is apty named! I
was sooo out of shape, but Samson kept on going; he's got the strength
of his namesake! Afterward I stayed behind for an hour or so to enjoy
the view and the autumn sunset, to pray and reflect on the day. It was
just beautiful, but it was amazing how quickly the temperature dropped
as the sun set.
