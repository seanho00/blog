I took one last trip down to Seattle to visit my old home church and
catch up with old friends; it was so much fun! There were terribly few
people from the English congregation, but I had a wonderful time
catching up with old family friends from the Chinese congregations: so
many wise and mature Christian brothers and sisters that I had taken for
granted while I was growing up. Coming back this time, my eyes opened to
just how cool they are and how much I have still to learn from them!
Rev. Paul Shen delivered a powerful and engaging series of messages on
the church's identity as the dwelling of Christ through the Holy Spirit.
I was especially struck by the reminder given in his last message in
Sunday service, of the parallel drawn in Ephesians 5 between the
husband-wife relationship and Christ to the church -- strong marriages
and strong families are the building blocks of a strong church.
