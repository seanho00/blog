English Sunday school at Fraserlands tends not to be terribly
well-attended, mostly because it's at 9:15am rather than 11am as it is
at the Knight St. campus. The class in the Fireside room has a pretty
broad range of people, from community college students on up to parents
of college students. Over the summer, Linda is leading a class on how to
study the Bible. I like her attitude towards Scripture: the deeper we
dive into the Word of God, the more it comes alive; and when we come
across a difficult or controversial passage, our response should not be
to throw up our hands and dismiss Scripture, but to dig even deeper,
reading the passage in context, so as not to misinterpret it. Here Linda
is excitedly diagramming the sentence flow of Ephesians 2:4-5.
