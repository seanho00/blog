***\*sigh\**** I'm up late tonight marking (grading) math midterms; I'm
about halfway done and just really need a break. The scores so far are
looking pretty abysmal, and there are a number of students who it looks
like just completely gave up. Sometimes, students will have this
conception that we enjoy giving out hard exams and low marks just to
watch them suffer; it's really not the case. Marking is always a pain,
and marking poor exams is awful drudgery. When the students are so
clearly just not getting the concepts, completely misunderstanding the
fundamentals, it really hurts. I wonder if anything's going in, if I'm
making a difference at all. This semester I have been going a bit faster
than we usually do, but in the big picture this math course is the very
lowest-level math course we offer; it's material that really properly
belongs at the high school level -- and I think it used to be that way
in generations past. Yet, I still end up having to fail over a quarter
of the class each semester. It hurts. But I know it's tough love that
has to be done.

      sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it
      yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
