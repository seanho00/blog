Welcome to my photo blog! I started it when I was just moving away from
North Carolina as I finished my Ph.D.; most of the posts chronicle my
journey in Vancouver, BC, as a teacher, preacher, friend, uncle, and
single guy. There's a big gap in my blog where I met and married my wife
-- sorry, if you want to know all the juicy details, you'll have to ask
us directly! Now we're slowly trying to pick up the blogging habit again
-- you'll read entries from both me and Dear Wifey!
