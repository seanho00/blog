Woot, what a fun and exhausting weekend! I had the great privilege to
hang out with and get to know 17 wonderful, precious kids from the
Chinese Christian Gospel Church youth groups at their first-ever youth
tent camping trip to Golden Ears Provincial Park. We all had a great
time together, nobody got hurt, and Sunday morning we even had a great
breakfast and abbreviated Sunday service, in the tents and in the rain!
Praise God for stirring in the hearts of these youth a willingness to
Dare to be Different, just like Daniel in the Bible. We'll see how long
they remember "Ick-Hick" -- Identity, Courage, Humility, and
Consistency!
