I first heard Dr. Milne guest speaking at Lord's Grace church in
Vancouver and was immediately impressed with his passionate and simple
presentation of God's Word. His lovely, impassioned, Scottish accent
helps, too! What I really appreciate is that his outlines are taken
straight from the outline of Scripture. Today, Dr. Milne's two points
are taken from Paul's two responses to God's calling on the road to
Damascus: "Who are you, Lord?", and "What shall I do, Lord?" \ `(Acts
22:6-10) <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ac22:6-10;&version=31>`__.
We first need to know (1) *who* we belong to, we need to know the heart
of God, before we can know (2) *what* we will do for Him. A simple,
clear two-point outline taken straight from the Bible!

This is the beef I have with structured devotionals like Rick Warren's
famous \ `"40 Days of Purpose" <http://www.purposedriven.com/>`__, or
even the \ `C&MA "Vision
prayer" <http://cmalliance.ca/visionprayerc611.php>`__ that we used
recently in a prayer meeting. I don't disagree with any individual
point, but the outline appears to be out of someone's head --
and \ *outline is content, too*. Why these 40 points? Why this order? Is
this exhaustive? Are some more important than others? Can they be
categorized hierarchically? Someone else could come up with a different
set of 40 points. The feeling I get is that the author first came up
with an outline, then thought, "hmm, what verses can I find to back up
my points?". That's a slippery slope! We need to read the Bible on its
own terms, without our own preconceived agenda, and mold our worldview
to fit it, rather than the other way around.

OK, off the soapbox again....
