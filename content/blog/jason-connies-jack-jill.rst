Jason and Connie are just the sweetest couple! They'll be getting
married this September at Fraser Lands; we're all excited for them! In
my eyes, they've always exemplified the childlike faith that Christ
calls us to have, a very pure, unshakeable faith and an earnest thirst
for God. They are both very caring and empathetic -- and exceedingly
cute together!

Today they had their "Jack and Jill" party -- kind of a combined
bachelor/bachelorette party. In the first part of the evening we had
separate guys/girls activities (I use the term "activities" loosely for
the guys -- mostly we just hung out on the couch, ate chips, and watched
sports on TV!). Then the girls joined us and we had some embarrassing
games for the couple, and plenty of food and mixing to be had all
around.

I was so glad to be there for this "Jack and Jill" party, to celebrate
with Jason+Connie, particularly because I won't be able to make it to
their actual wedding. I would have loved to be there for them to lead
songs at the wedding, but Dan's wedding in NC is the same day, and Dan
has subtly threatened me with organized crime syndicates from two
countries if I don't come to his wedding! :)
