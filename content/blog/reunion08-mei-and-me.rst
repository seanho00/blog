OK, so you know how Facebook and MySpace are full of girls taking
up-close, wide-angle self-portraits by holding their digital cameras at
arms' length? Turns out it's not quite so easy to do with a 2-lb
professional digital SLR.... it does have two shutter buttons, but I
ended up tilting a bit diagonally so that I could cradle it in one hand
and reach the shutter with my thumb. Plus, I couldn't see through the
viewfinder, so it was kind of hit-or-miss.

Here're Mei-mei and Jake playing with me in their basement, the last
night we have together before I fly off. I love Mei's laugh, when she
throws herself fully into it!
