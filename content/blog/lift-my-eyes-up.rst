God reminded me of something tonight, while I was sitting in my car,
with the rain streaming down the windshield:

If I look to the church for encouragement and hope, I only get
frustration and disappointment. If I look to my friends, I only get
sympathy. If I look to myself, I only get futility and uncertainty.

But if I lift my eyes up to the loving Saviour Jesus Christ, I behold
perfection and beauty. I am comforted in the knowledge that He holds us
all in the palm of His hand -- the church, my friends and relationships,
and even my very heart. I must trust that He knows what He's doing, and
that He will accomplish His plan in His perfect timing. If I take
matters into my own hands, I fall into the same trap of Abraham with
Hagar, or Moses with the Egyptian.

    | I lift up my eyes to the hills -- where does my help come from?
    |  My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
    |  (Psalm 121:1-2, NIV)
