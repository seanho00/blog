Steve and a bunch of other LIGHT friends and I headed out to Kits beach
for dinner and the annual Festival of Lights fireworks show. It was
pretty packed, but it was nice to hang out and chat for a couple hours
until it got dark and the fireworks started. This year there were four
countries that put on displays; Mexico won first place for its beautiful
colours and creative "sombrero" designs. They broadcast a soundtrack
over the radio, too.
