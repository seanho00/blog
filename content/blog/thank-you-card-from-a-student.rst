This is from last Spring semester, but I reread it just now and it
really is so touching! Wow, such a privilege that the thread of my life
can intersect with the threads of students like this as God weaves His
majestic tapestry. Stuff like this is why I'm here at Trinity; these
little notes are better than promotions or tenure!
