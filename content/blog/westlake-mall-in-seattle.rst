Here I am at the Canadian Consulate in Seattle, doing one of the last
bits of paperwork for my Canadian permanent residency, yay! They
promised same-day turnaround, so I have a few hours to kill here in
downtown Seattle while waiting. The consulate is on the sixth floor of
the tall beige building on the right with square windows. In the
distance on the right is the 1201 3rd Ave Washington Mutual building
that I will visit (next blog entry). The small triangularish building at
the bottom is one of zillions of Starbuck's; I got a grande decaf
caramel mocha to warm me up while I was walking around.
