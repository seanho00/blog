            <p>Whew, the summer season is in full swing now, and for me that means
church camps! Eight this summer, just about one every other week!</p>
<p>This weekend is the New Life gospel camp, a family camp with about 220
people, organized by Paul and Meiling and their bible study group. Since
it's positioned as a gospel camp, they didn't want to compete with
church camps, and intended for it to be aimed toward non-Christians who
are seeking. I had charge of the 20-odd teenagers, together with a team
of four or five other counsellors. The coworkers were from all over the
area, different churches, so some of us hadn't even met before the camp!
But we worked well together as a team; praise God!</p>
<p>This year we ended up having a lot of joint activities between the teens
and the younger children; that was a lot of fun! But handling 53 kids
ages 3-16 in one enclosed room (with echo-y linoleum floors) was quite
an experience! Praise God that all of us coworkers really had a united
heart to bring the kids to the feet of Jesus.</p>
<p>The whole weekend, I was running around scrambling at my usual frenetic
pace, so I didn't get to take any pictures with my camera. This frame
was shot by one of my boys Dustin, during our small group
discussion/hang-out time with the seven junior-high boys in my small
room. I think we spent more time tossing the ball around, blowing
bubbles, and repairing LED flashlights than we spent in deep sharing,
but it was time well-spent!</p>
