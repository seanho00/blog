Phew, it's been a bit warm lately! With no air-conditioning at home,
we've been resorting to hiding out in stairwells and the garage to try
to get some relief. I really need an attic fan! The other day, my mom
actually took an afternoon nap in my car, because the ground-floor
garage is the coolest place in my house!

So for dinner tonight, rather than getting even warmer by cooking at
home, we decided to go out and try this new swanky restaurant along
200th, Waterhouse Grill. It was on the more upscale side of things, but
not overly pricey, compared with, say, Coza's Tuscan in Langley. The
beef brisket was superb. I liked the architecture and decor, although
they don't have much of a view besides that of the lovely parking lot
and the auto shop next door.
