**\*sigh\***, so tired... today was a rather long day at church, with a
lengthy (though interesting) congregational meeting all afternoon. But
why is it that church lately so often drains, stresses, and depresses me
instead of energizing? A walk around this nearby lake in the springtime
sun, some time to think and pray, helps me to recover....

My mom often says, "Christians should be joyful!" -- not necessarily
giddy-happy, but joyful in the Lord. The speaker last week mentioned how
restaurant workers really do notice the behaviour of Christians when
they go out for lunch after church -- and how so many are sullen,
complaintative, uncommunicative with their kids, condescending to
waitstaff -- and stingy tippers. It's true!
