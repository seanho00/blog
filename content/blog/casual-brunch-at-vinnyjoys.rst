Yay, I'm back in North Carolina for CBCNC's annual retreat at the beach!
I flew in a day early, arriving late Thu night, and Vin+Joy were
gracious enough to put me up for the night (in the room being setup for
the new baby!). Here I am chilling in Vin's kitchen after a nice brunch;
Joy was playing around with my cellphone.
