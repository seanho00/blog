It's been a real treat to get to know the folks at South Vancouver PG
church; they've been so welcoming and seem to have a real thirst for
God's Word. As with many relationships, this one has developed over time
-- both chronological time (about a year, I think, with my family; about
six months with me directly) as well asÂ \ *"kairos"* time -- singular
events that move things forward, like speaking in their English service
and church retreat.

Today I met with Pastors Matthew and Justin to discuss and pray over the
needs of their church and how I might be able to help out in some small
way. I am really honoured and humbled by their invitation and am looking
forward to preaching a short series here once a month, as well as
ministering to their leadership discipleship small group. After the
retreat, I think the bar has been set high -- their expectations of me
are pretty bold! But it's done in a good way, with an encouraging
spirit, and it's good accountability for me, pushing me to be in-depth
and faithful to Scripture, while also practical and challenging in
exhortation.

I do love this congregation, and I am looking forward not only that I
get to spend some time together with them, but also, hopefully, that I
can be of some benefit and encouragement to them in the Word of God! As
for my own church, I do still care very deeply about our people, and
there is such a pervasive need here for deeper Biblical teaching: I
really want to do something about it, but at this point I'm not in much
of a position to do that! I think these things have to come by God's
leading and by invitation, and I haven't "worked my way up the ladder"
at VCAC, so for now I guess I'll stick to serving behind the scenes, at
a grassroots level, one person at a time. I have to remind myself that I
cannot change the church: changing hearts is God's work!
