Oof, the past few weeks have been quite tiring; it's that time of
semester again, about a month before finals, and everyone is tired and
stressed out -- both students as well as teachers! I've found rest and a
bit of a guilty pleasure in some light leisure reading in the evening:
Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre", which I \ `picked up not long
ago </2007/an-afternoon-with-richard>`__. I quite like it! The effusive
descriptions of landscape and character are so immersive, and I love the
Romantic picture of external weather reflecting internal emotions. The
character of St. John also really made me think -- he's a very driven,
self-disciplined, noble servant of God, but he sacrificed his own love
towards Rosamund because of his sense of duty and calling. I wonder how
effective he'd be preaching the gospel and communicating God's love when
he had denied his own heart in this way....

Next on my list: "Pride and Prejudice"!
