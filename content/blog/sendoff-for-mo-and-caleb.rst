Our dear brothers Moses and Caleb are leaving us -- perhaps for a long
time! Awww.... Mo is gallivanting off to China and the Middle East to
pursue God's work with his parents, and Caleb is traipsing off to
Calgary to pursue God's preparation in seminary at Ambrose!

As a special treat, we got to cheer Mo on as he got baptised (for the
third time!). Following the spirit of the Ethiopian eunuch with Philip
-- "Here is water; what prevents me from being baptised?" -- we went to
nearby Coquitlam River, at the foot of a highway/railway underpass
(which was wicked loud!).

| We're so proud of Mo and Caleb, and we will miss them terribly!
