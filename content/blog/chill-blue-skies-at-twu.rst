It's such a beautiful day today! The skies are pure blue, the sunshine
is blindingly bright, the air is clean and fresh -- and it is soooo
cold! The view of the mountains is amazing, too (alas, it wouldn't be
visible on my dinky wide-angle cell-phone camera!).

This photo is from the centre of campus, a circular courtyard with a
small topiary of the TWU flame. In the background is the Reimer Student
Centre; the cafeteria is inside and to the right.
