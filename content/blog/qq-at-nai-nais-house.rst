Our big trip today was a 2.5hr drive up to LA to visit my
brother-in-law's mom and other relatives. We all got up fairly early for
the drive, so when we arrived at "Nai-nai"'s house (QQ's paternal
grandmother), the kids were a little antsy to get out and play. DD made
a bee-line for the stash of matchbox cars -- the very same cars that his
dad played with when he was small! QQ took a bit of entertainment by
finding her current location on this light-up globe, with the help of
her dad. Later on, we had lunch with Ivans' grandmother, aunts+uncles,
and cousins. I was joking around with my sister: my relationship to them
is that I'm their ... nephew's wife's brother ... which makes me ...
about as closely related to them as the waiter is. :)Â We still had a
good time, though!
