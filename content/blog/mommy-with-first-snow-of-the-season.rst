Well, between last night and this morning, we've got about 15cm/6in of
snow, and it's still falling! Rather few of the roads are being plowed,
so we're kinda stuck at home. I had been planning on going to Knight St.
church in Vancouver today, but gave up on that idea... then we thought
of walking to the small neighbourhood church that meets at the middle
school across the street, but eventually gave up on that, too! So my mom
and I stayed at home and prayed together; we watched the Crystal
Cathedral's "Hour of Power" on TV (not too pleased with Robert
Schuller's "prosperity gospel": the sermon was rather disappointing,
mostly asking for money) and a Radio Bible Class program on Saul
(walking through various Holy Land sites; that was pretty cool!).
Afterward, we hung up my IKEA curtains and relaxed by the fire. The snow
makes everything so quiet and peaceful and bright!
