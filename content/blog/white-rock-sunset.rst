I cannot survive without Sabbaths. It's a claim in the Bible, it's an
observed fact, and it's the cry of my heart.

This year as a whole, I've been perpetually barely nose-above-water, and
once midterms hit, the all-nighters to finish marking homeworks and
exams really took a toll. Last night SCAC had a wonderful "FAT" (Family
Activity Time) at the gym, and we had a lot of fun playing badminton,
but there were times I was so tired I got a bit dizzy; just couldn't
think straight.

But today I did get a real Sabbath, a chance to rest in Jesus, to let
the wind carry away all the voices and to-do lists, controversies and
politics, and wait upon the Lord. I got a good night's sleep, had a good
lunch, and drove out here to the waterfront and beach at White Rock. In
the summertime it's quite a tourist spot, and even in the chill wind and
patchy clouds of this brisk March day, there are still quite a lot of
people out on the waterfront walkway. I venture out onto the wide flats
at low tide, where there are fewer people and the sand is soft beneath
my sandals. The sand is moist and dotted with patches of bright green
sea grass.

On other lonesome beach excursions I'll have chats, even debates, with
God, praying my heart out and listening for His reply. But not today. Of
late my head has just been too full of words -- too many things to think
about, hats to wear, people to shepherd, irons in the fire. I have
half-a-dozen summer retreats to be preparing for in parallel, sermons,
Sunday schools, discipleship, planning. How should I allocate my time;
who should I invest time in to get to know better; who do I have to let
go of.

Today, on this beach, I speak no words to God, and I hear no words from
Him, and it is okay. Sometimes words don't need to be said. In His
presence, my heart is quieted by His love -- to trust in Him, to be
still and know that He is God.

    | The LORD your God is with you, he is mighty to save.
    |  He will take great delight in you,
    |  he will quiet you with his love,
    |  he will rejoice over you with singing.
    |  `(Zephaniah
