Whew! Today we had a rare joint activity with another Fraser Lands small
group, Maggie Li's group! It was a load of fun to be together with them,
old and new friends, lots of yummy food, some good exercise walking
around the inlet, and good fellowship. I was kind of out of it for most
of the time -- I think there were some folks in Maggie's group that I
didn't even get a chance to meet -- but I think it went off without a
hitch. We should do more joint activities in the future!
