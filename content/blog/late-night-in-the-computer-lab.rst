Yes, so normally our \ `CMPT140 <http://cmpt14x.seanho.com/>`__ class
has three TAs who each take a four-hour evening shift in the computer
lab each week, helping students with their programming projects. But one
of my TAs is sick this week, so I decided to fill in for her; I have a
ton of statistics marking to do, anyway. It certainly makes for a long
day at work, though, staying until 10pm! Just the other day in office
hours one of my math students made this offhand comment about how her
professors who are single seemed to have more time to spend with
students. Ha, that's just 'cause we have no life outside work! :) Then
she added, "but some of them seem more unhappy, too". awww....
