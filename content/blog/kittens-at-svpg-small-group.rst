Tonight I had the opportunity to sit in
onÂ \ `SVPG's <http://photo.seanho.com/blog/svan_pacific_grace_church>`__
"Excellence" discipleship small group, newly started by Pastor Justin.
Nora brought four newborn orphan kittens to try to give away; they're so
adorable! Here PJ is settling the one male in his own box separate from
the females.

I was pleasantly surprised at the large turnout tonight: sixteen people
ranging from high school to university to young parents, all excited
about being challenged and stretched to grow in their faith, wherever
they are in their walk with Christ. Pastor Justin has positioned the
group as "only for those who want to be challenged", who want to do
something extra to grow -- there's no obligation to join; it's okay to
not join and still be a good Christian. So the sixteen people who came
are a real answer to prayer! Tonight PJ preached passionately on
peacemaking, inspired by John 17:24 and Matthew 5:9. The sharing around
the table afterward was so honest and vulnerable; it was really quite
refreshing, and promising for the future growth of the group.
