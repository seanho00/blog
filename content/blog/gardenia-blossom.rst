Ah, the sweet fragrance of gardenia! We had a gardenia back when we
lived in Seattle; it did very well and grew to be quite a bush. In
season, dozens of flowers would fill the room with the distinctive
scent. My good pal Dennis is the caretaker of that plant now, down in
the Seattle area; I'm still thinking of bringing a cutting back. But
getting successful cuttings from gardenias is very tricky, so I figured
I'd get a gardenia up here to try my hand first. Of course, this one
(Vetchii) has been in greenhouse conditions, so it came with nearly a
dozen buds. I fully expected most of them to drop off with the shock of
being in a different environment, but so far none have fallen, and here
I even have the first blossom! Yay!
