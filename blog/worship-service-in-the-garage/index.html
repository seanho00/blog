            <p>Today was a good day. I stopped worrying about what areas of ministry to
get involved in at church, as if it would define me or earn me
credentials in the eyes of the church. I will serve, but it'll be for
the right reasons, by God's calling, and not out of guilt or obligation
or even just "the need". In the meantime, the more quality time I spend
with God, the better equipped I am to encourage and reach out to
everyone I come across, building up relationships and crossing barriers.</p>
<p>This afternoon, this was my church sanctuary, lying on my workout bench,
with praise and worship music wafting from my car's stereo a few feet
away. The sermon was simply God's Word: I read the entire book of Hosea
and dwelt on its message of hope and undeserved compassion. We who were
rebellious and not God's people, He now calls <em>"Ammi":</em> "my people".
We who had not received compassion, He now calls <em>"Ruhamah":</em> "those
who have received compassion". Hosea's whole life, marriage, and family
were all one big message God used to speak to the people. His life was
very dramatic, but I have to say I hope my marriage isn't as extreme as
Hosea's! It was so refreshing, though, to sit and pray and meditate on
God's Word for two hours. Afterward I went upstairs to my guitar and
sang my heart out with hymns and praise songs of response. Now I'm ready
for corporate worship tomorrow morning!</p>
