The sun has just set, and both the blue skies above and the green earth
below deepen to shades of grey. A father and his son play with a small
remote-controlled car in the empty sandlot. Along the quiet pathway, a
well-dressed elderly Asian gentleman walks alone. The first three stars
of evening have come out: the day is officially complete. There is sound
of traffic and construction site generators in the distance, but for me
sitting here on my bedroom windowsill, there's only
theÂ \ `song <http://songs.seanho.com/son_of_god.html>`__ in my heart:

    | Son of God, shaper of the stars
    |  You alone, the dweller of my heart
    |  Mighty King, how beautiful You are, how beautiful!
