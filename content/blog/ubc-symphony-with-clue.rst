Tonight was nice; Elaine (on behalf of CLUE) invited me to join their
group outing to the Chan Centre to hear the UBC Symphony Orchestra. It
was quite good; I liked the Ravel, particularly the prelude. The
Glazunov concerto was an impressively technical showcase for the
saxophone soloist, but I didn't find the piece terribly musically
compelling; maybe I just didn't "get" the message. There was also a
Mendelssohn concerto that was stirring and exciting; a timeless classic.
We also saw Abraham from KS in the violin section! And the son of a
colleague of mine at TWU was playing first cello.

Jason snapped this self-portrait of the two of us by hand: Connie tried
several times to take a photo, but my overly-complicated Treo phone
didn't like her for some reason! Afterward most all of us went out to
Kerrisdale for food; that was relaxing and enjoyable -- especially with
those bells!
