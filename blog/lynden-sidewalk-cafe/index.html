            <p><strong>TGIF</strong> -- I am really thankful to God that it's Friday! It's been a
long winter and a long semester. I thank God for giving me little
reminders to slow down, to "do" less activity and "be" more of Christ's
character -- to talk less and listen more, to be grateful and joyful for
God's providence, and to let go of worry. Last week, one of my students
popped by my office hours just to encourage me and thank me for doing
devotions every day in class. Then he added, "I hope you're able to take
a real Sabbath rest this weekend; it looks like you need it." It's true;
I really needed to block out time to rest with God and be grateful for
what He's given. A couple weeks ago, a church friend with whom I hadn't
chatted for several months gave me a firm reminder and exhortation just
to let go, to enjoy the community at church and not to try to fix all
the problems. Our <a class="reference external" href="/2007/rivendell-with-jon-and-elaine">visit to
Rivendell</a> last week was a good
reminder, too, of how I need regularly to rest in God's presence, not
worrying about my life or future, but just trusting that God will lead
the way one step at a time.</p>
<p>Classes end early for me on Fridays, so after praise chapel today I took
my regular trip south of the border to fetch mail and gas up. It's
always a nice feeling being back in the States -- although I suppose
it's purely psychological! The drive out to Aldergrove and then to
Lynden is so beautiful and relaxing. People ask me about the long
commute I have to church, and I tell them that I actually enjoy driving!
(It's just the traffic that's not so pleasant! :) ) Even when I'm stuck
in traffic, it's a strangely liberating feeling to know that I can't do
anything about it -- I've done my responsibility, and the rest is out of
my hands -- so I might as well enjoy the time. I can always crank
up <a class="reference external" href="http://praise1065.com/">Praise 106.5 FM</a>, or the MP3 player,
and worship God in music and prayer.</p>
<p>As I'm typing this, I've just finished my late lunch in Lynden, at the
lovely Sidewalk Cafe. The shops are lined up in a tidy little replica of
a Dutch street, complete with canal, footbridges, streetlights, and park
benches -- all indoors! Rather handy considering all the rainy weather
we get around here. As I was walking in, I saw a young father in his
early 30s holding his crying daughter, about 6 years old, in his lap.
She was rather upset about something (I later overheard that it was
because she was unable to wear her new flowery dress for today) and
wasn't too happy with her daddy, but yet was still clinging around his
neck, as he reasoned softly with her and held her gently. I have to
confess that seeing this made me a little teary-eyed; it was such a
touching scene. I thought of saying something to him just to encourage
him that he was being a good dad, but in the end I chickened out. His
tenderness reminded me that even when we are upset or downtrodden in
life, even when we are mad <em>at</em> God, our Heavenly Father still holds
us tight in his arms, gently speaking words of Truth, alluring us back
with His love.</p>
