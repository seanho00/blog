The retreat this weekend was such a powerful, refreshing, challenging,
tiring, sweet time of fellowship together! It was a real privilege and
joy to share the weekend and share God's Word with the English
congregation at SVPGMBC. (That's the South Vancouver Pacific Grace
Mennonite Brethren Church -- whew, quite a mouthful!) Our theme on both
the Chinese and English sides was the book of Philippians, "To Live is
Christ".

Conveniently, the retreat location was at TWU: that made it rather easy
for me! I even got to go home after the late-night snack time, to sleep
in my nice soft bed with a down comforter in a quiet room, ahhh.... :)
Meanwhile poor Pastor Justin had to stay up into the wee hours of the
morning to keep the kids in their rooms. I've been retreat speaker and
camp counselor many many times, and being a camp counselor is much more
tiring than being a speaker!

Here, Pi fellowship is in the cafeteria celebrating Pastor
Justin+Yvonne's first anniversary by singing Lifehouse's "You and Me".
Carlin sang this song for them at their wedding one year ago; aww, how
sweet!

The young people here have such energy and enthusiasm to learn from the
Scriptures and serve in the church. I was so impressed to see that
nearly half of them already have a regular habit of personal devotions
with God -- the usual ratio for most churches I've spoken at is around
10-15%! Good job -- but still not good enough! ;) Need to read through
the entire Bible, cover-to-cover: it's our owner's manual for life!

Many people, young and old, English side and Chinese side, shared with
me about some of the struggles and sorrows they had with church
politics; it both saddened and surprised me that they too are dealing
with these issues, just like my own church. But I was much heartened to
see that brothers and sisters from all corners of the church have a
heartfelt desire to bridge the gaps, to communicate with and understand
one another, and to work together for the kingdom of God. The
relationship is akin to that of a parent with a grown adult child -- and
strong families are the necessary building blocks for strong churches.

May the Lord continue to grant them abounding love, in
knowledge \ *(epi-gnosis)* and insight \ *(ais-thei-sis)*, so that they
can approve \ *(doki-mazo)* what is excellent \ *(dia-phero)*, and stand
pure \ *(ei-li-krineis)* and blameless \ *(apo-skopoi)* in the day of
Christ. With God's help, I know that they will be able to discern the
majors from the minors, to speak boldly of the gospel, and to persevere
in unity under the banner of Jesus Christ!
