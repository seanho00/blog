Today being Sunday, we had church -- in our hotel room! We sang a bunch
of kids' songs like "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" and "Jesus
Loves Me" -- complete with hand motions. We had a good, short
congregational prayer. My sisters took the kids out for Sunday School
and crafts, while my dad shared a detailed message with the rest of us.
Then we had lunch afterwards! Here the kids are being entertained by
Anma telling a wonderful story in Mandarin; this is nearly all the kids,
we're just missing Jacob.
