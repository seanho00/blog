Awww, it's the four of us siblings! This is during a rare moment when
all the kids are either napping or playing on their own or with one of
the other parents. We spent a few hours earlier in the afternoon at the
big water park adjoining the hotel, but it was awfully crowded and noisy
and hot on the holiday weekend, so we moved here to the hotel's own
swimming pool. Much better here, only a few other people, quiet and you
can hear yourself think!
