Yes, so every time we get together as a family, our mom really wants
  us to have a nice family portrait -- so she can show us off everywhere
  she goes, of course! One family reunion back before any of the kids
  were born, we had a family portrait that included my sister-in-law
  before they got married -- I think it was even before they were
  engaged.

That family photo got circulated through the many churches my parents
  speak at, and even got published in one of their books. Fortunately,
  my brother did marry her -- it would have been mighty awkward if they
  hadn't gotten married and she was still in those books!

This photo is just in our hotel room, with all the kids piled on the
bed, and the adults around them. We're kind of grouped by families,
except that Jake is in the wrong spot. Ah well, it's a lot better than
can be hoped for! We were able to take three bursts of shots before the
overlapping windows of happiness for all the little ones started
closing....
