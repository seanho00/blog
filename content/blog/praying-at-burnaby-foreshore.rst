I'm looking forward to this coming weekend's youth leadership camp run
by \ `CCM <http://ccmcanada.org/>`__: it is always a joy to work with
kids, and camps are inevitably tremendously enjoyable, rewarding,
exhausting, and challenging! This camp will be my fourth one this
summer, I think, with two more to go!

Allen, on the ball as usual, many months ago set the overall theme
("Missing Pieces") and the focus for my evening talks ("integrity"). But
I needed to set aside some time to focus and prepare spiritually for the
weekend, so here I am on the banks of the Fraser, in the cool shade of
the willows, praying through my devotions in Genesis15.

It's interesting to analyze my sermon-preparation methodology, and how
it has changed over the years. I am still tempted to jump right into
the \ *task* of the talk, the obligatory three-point outline and
PowerPoint bulleted lists. I can easily get distracted with slick
animated transitions and pretty clipart -- it's a bottomless time-sink.

But the preparation I \ *really* need is to make sure my heart is in
line with God's -- to confess my struggles to Him, to cast my cares upon
Him, and to lift my eyes to the heavens, to the Saviour who calls me to
His service according to His purpose and power. When my spirit is
attentive to the quiet voice of the Holy Spirit, then the message,
outline, anecdotes, and everything else fall into place very naturally!
The times I get into trouble are when my own agenda and pride get in the
way of God's working. :) My reflections carry me to God's covenant
promise to Abram, when he was a sojourner in a foreign land, and still
childless:

    | [God] took him outside and said, "Look up at the heavens and count
      the stars -- if indeed you can count them."
    |  Then He said to him, "So shall your offspring be."
    |  `(Genesis
      15:5) <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&search=Gen15:5>`__

To behold the natural beauty of creation, whether the brilliant stars in
the inky night sky or the soft breeze now whispering against my cheek,
is to behold a testimony of the glory of the Creator. The same God who
made each star and calls them by name also calls me by name and cares
for me, small and insignificant though I may be. He provided a son and a
legacy for Abram; and if it is His will, He will provide a family for
me, too -- in His timing. I just need to continue in the faith that
Abram had: simply to take God at His word.

    | Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as
      righteousness.
    |  `(Genesis
      15:6) <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&search=Gen15:6>`__
