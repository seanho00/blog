            <p>This weekend and next I'm down in Seattle speaking with my parents at
the missions conference of my old home
church, <a class="reference external" href="http://eccseattle.org/">ECC</a>. Even just in the couple days
I've been down here so far, such a flood of emotions has swept me up; I
haven't had a chance to catch my breath until today. Coupled with
chronic lack of sleep this school year, it was a bit overwhelming (but
joyous!) for me. Thankfully, this week is our spring reading break, so
today I got a chance to sleep in and let my body recover. The photo
above is from Dennis' lovely nature-filled backyard, surrounded by
Douglas firs and cedars, set to the tune of chirping birds, awash in the
warm light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>ECC is the church I was born and grew up in; I have a lot of good
memories here, and still have a lot of aunties and uncles, brothers and
sisters in Christ here -- real family! Just to see the faces of those
old friends, and to know that they're still faithfully serving the Lord,
is so incredibly powerful and moving.</p>
<p>And yet, I'm also aware of the myriad problems within the church -- so
very similar to the problems at the large Chinese churches I'm involved
with back in Vancouver. So much structure, but so little communication.
So many full-service programs, but so many people running on empty.
Living in the lap of luxury, yet still needy, demanding, complaining.
The "silent exodus" of second-generation Chinese.</p>
<p>Several here have made no secret about wanting me to come back, say as a
youth pastor at EKC -- my Uncle Peter is already there leading things.
It would be such an honour to be working alongside the likes of Willy
and Nate, who were <em>my</em> youth counselors when I was high-school age!
But, as the saying goes, you don't just marry one person, you marry into
a whole family. And if I were to be on staff anywhere in the ECC system
... oh boy, that would, shall we say, require a <em>lot</em> of prayer....</p>
<p>I care deeply about my home church here. I remember her in prayer, and
though I feel quite helpless, I know she is Christ's bride, and He is
the one who will clean her up. It was such an immense privilege to stand
before my own extended church family and share the word of God last
Sunday at the EKC campus. The English congregation has grown
tremendously! I'm a little nervous now about next Sunday, when I'll be
preaching in English service at the Seattle campus -- I'll be addressing
many of my uncles and aunties, many of whom changed my diapers when I
was small! :)</p>
<p>ECC-EKC is very efficient about getting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eccseattle.org/ekc/sermons-english/">their sermons posted
online</a>; here
is <a class="reference external" href="http://seanho.com/church/EKC-080224-Freedom.wmv">the audio recording of my sermon from Isaiah 61:1-4, titled,
"FREEDOM!" (12MB 52min
wmv)</a>. It starts
from Elton's congregational prayer, then runs through my (slightly
over-time) message, wrapping up with the <a class="reference external" href="http://songs.seanho.com/god_of_justice.html">response
song</a> that Kelvin
graciously let me lead for the congregation. I always get a bit scared
and embarrassed to listen to a recording of myself! (Is my voice really
that squeaky?) :)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> The following week I got to speak at the main Seattle campus
of ECC -- it's the very sanctuary and congregation I grew up in, and it
was pretty emotional for me. Here's <a class="reference external" href="http://seanho.com/church/ECC-080302-Missions_and_the_Sabbath.wmv">my sermon from Isaiah 58,
"Missions and the Sabbath" (9MB 38min
wmv)</a>.</p>
