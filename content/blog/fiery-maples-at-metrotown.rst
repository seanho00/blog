Today is Thanksgiving here in Canada, and during these few hours I have
in between appointments, I find solace here in a little park behind
MetroTown.

Metropolis at MetroTown is a huge, sprawling, three-story shopping mall,
with two levels of underground parking and several attached restaurants
and other shops above ground. Within a block on either side, there are
also a couple other shopping malls like Station Square and Crystal Mall.
Especially on a holiday like today, it's a crowded, noisy mecca of
buying and selling, entertainment and excess, "consume and enjoy".

But just a few paces away from the retail core, at the foot of the
now-empty MetroTowers office buildings, nestles this tiny little park,
probably designed for office workers to enjoy their lunch breaks. A
small rectangular plot of grass lies in the middle, with an intriguing
mound at its centre -- is it some historical marker? An ancient First
Nations burial ground preserved amidst the rest of this new
construction? Or just a load of extra dirt? :) The maples surrounding
the rectangular grass plot are majestic in their peak fall colour --
deep red on the side opposite me; light amber on the side where I'm
sitting. Behind them, a slab of sleek steel and glass rises into the
brilliant blue sky.

Whenever people at church ask me how I'm doing, I make every effort to
avoid giving a flippant reply, "Fine". OK, maybe sometimes they don't
really want to hear my whole life story starting from when I was a wee
tadpole, but I really want to be honest, so recently I've been saying,
with all honesty, "Angsty".

An acquaintance of mine, Brian, recently shared about the point in his
life when things were getting really serious with his then girlfriend
(later wife). He got commitment-shy and ran for the hills -- more
specifically, he climbed a mountain in Africa. He tells of sitting on
top of the mountain, watching the sun rise over the foothills. It was so
beautiful -- and he had no one to share it with. He says it was like a
"sword in the heart". He climbed down the mountain and immediately
proposed to his wife (over the phone!).

My personal devotions recently have been in the book of Exodus, and I
wonder what it must have been like to see God's pillar of cloud by day
and pillar of fire by night, leading Israel through the wilderness every
day for so many years. Even the manna God provided every morning was a
daily miracle -- but the Israelites soon took it for granted,
complaining about the lack of selection on the menu! As I reflect on my
life on this Thanksgiving day, I know that it is not that God has not
been showing me His will for my life, but that I have taken for granted
His constant hand of guidance. I read aloud the words of Psalm 77:

    | My heart mused and my spirit inquired:
    |  "Will the Lord reject forever?
    |  Will he never show his favour again?
    |  Has his unfailing love vanished forever?
    |  Has his promise failed for all time?
    |  Has God forgotten to be merciful?
    |  Has he in anger withheld his compassion?"
    |  Selah
    |  `(Psalm
      77:6-9) <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps77:6-9>`__

The Hebrew word \ *Selah* indicates, we think, a pause for
contemplation, before a brief shout, and moving on:

    | Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years of the right
      hand of the Most High."
    |  I will remember the deeds of the LORD;
    |  yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.
    |  ... You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
      Aaron.
    |  `(Psalm 77:10-11,
      20) <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps77:10-11,20>`__

The pillar of fire has always been there, leading me, but I just treat
it like a night-light. I need to keep on trusting in Him every step of
the way -- He will open the right doors at the right time, and make the
next step such a natural, clear choice that it is evident to all that
God has done this.

It is almost time for my next appointment. I close my personal worship
time with God by singing aloud in this secluded, sunshine-filled
spot, \ `this classic
hymn: <http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/h/l/hleademe.htm>`__

    | He leadeth me, O blessed thought!
    |  O words with heav'nly comfort fraught!
    |  Whate'er I do, where'er I be
    |  Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

    | He leadeth me, He leadeth me,
    |  By His own hand He leadeth me;
    |  His faithful follower I would be,
    |  For by His hand He leadeth me.
