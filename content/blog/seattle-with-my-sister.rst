Our short overnight trip to Seattle this weekend was kind of bittersweet
-- the primary purpose of the trip was for a memorial service for my
uncle, who recently passed away in Seattle. Extended-family gatherings
are more and more difficult as the years pass; our clan gets larger and
more disperse. It was so nice to see the uncles and aunts, and the
handful of cousins, who came to the memorial service, but our time
together was really short, only a few hours for most of them before they
had to catch their flights. The day was such a rushed jumble of emotions
that I didn't think to snap a picture at the memorial service. But my
sister's family stayed an extra day, so the next day we went to the
Science Center and Space Needle to do some touristy stuff with the kids.
The weather was the cloudy-drizzly nap weather typical of Seattle -- but
at least there weren't big crowds!
