It's funny, I never really liked the taste of alcohol, but I like grape
juice! I've sampled some world-famous wines in California and France,
beers in Germany and Belgium, and while I can appreciate how others
could get into wine tasting because of the complexities of flavour, it's
just never struck a chord for me.

Ah, but a good, high-quality Concord grape juice -- that I can get into!
On this crisp Sunday morning, it's a nice way to wake up before heading
out to church. Yes, my glass tumbler has a crack in it, and yes, it's a
little slanted -- that's what you get for a dollar at WalMart! :)
