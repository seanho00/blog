Friend-of-a-friend Eva is moving up this weekend to come work for the
new Microsoft office in Richmond, so I'm doing some scouting for housing
for her! This is a nice 1-bedroom ground-floor suite originally designed
for the owner's mother-in-law. I really like the quiet neighbourhood,
very kid-friendly. There's even a little solarium inside for plants!

I generally know my way around Richmond, but I don't often get a chance
to walk around the residential neighbourhoods and take in the atmosphere
-- I'm usually rushing, driving around to the Chinese restaurants in the
busy north end. So it's nice to visit the quieter parts of town.
