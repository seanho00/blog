My mommy and daddy pop into town every few months or so in their
travels; they've been living by faith in God's calling for the past
fifteen years or so, going anywhere God calls them and churches invite
them. They happen to be in town this weekend, so we went out to a nice
little sushi place nearby my house; it's within walking distance (though
not on a rainy day like today!). That's a yummy lobster roll in front of
us.
