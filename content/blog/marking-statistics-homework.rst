Marking, marking, marking, always more marking! (That's "grading" for
the U.S. folks.) Here's the fruit of my labour for the last two and a
half hours -- I've marked a total of nearly 400 questions and given out
a total of 1155 points. Had to finish it tonight so I can hand them back
at tomorrow's 8am class. I do love teaching, especially the face-to-face
interaction with the students, but I don't know of a teacher alive who
actually enjoys marking! I need to start selecting only certain
questions for marking.

Apologies for the lapse in blogging; it's what happens when I get busy!
There was lots of fun stuff over last weekend, from visiting the
Souljourners college fellowship to speaking at Burnaby Alliance's
Mandarin college group to a hilarious potluck dinner with JonC's small
group. Lots of good stuff to blog about... but... right now... I'm just
reeeeaally hungry and tired....!
