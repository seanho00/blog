My colleague and friend Alma finished her Ph.D. here at Simon Fraser
University just last year, so she still has a lot of good contacts in
the computer science department. SFU has the second-largest CS
department in Canada, second only to U Waterloo, so they have a lot more
resources than TWU does, we with our grand total of four full-time
faculty members in CS! We listened to an interview talk by
world-renowned medical image analyst Baba Vemuri, had lunch with a
Alma's friends Veronica and Kim, and briefly toured the famous
terraced-mountaintop architecture on campus, designed by Arthur
Erickson. Yes, I believe the Quad in the background of this picture was
used by "Battlestar Galactica" for a busy pre-Cylon Caprica City.
