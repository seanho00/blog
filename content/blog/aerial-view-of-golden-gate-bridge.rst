This week I'm visiting my sister and her family down in sunny San Diego
-- I get to skip out on the cloudy drizzly 15°C Vancouver weather and
enjoy bright sunshine and upper-70°F temps! Here, as I approach a
layover stop in San Francisco, I get a nice aerial view of the famous
Golden Gate Bridge. Downtown San Fran is off-frame to the right and
above, and the fancy community of Sausalito is on the left (north) side
of the bridge.
