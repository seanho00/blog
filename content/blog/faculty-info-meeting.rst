We're now really gearing up for the start of the school year, and things
are getting pretty hectic. This morning was a three-hour-long faculty
meeting, mostly filled with all sorts of course requirements and reports
from the various faculty deans. We've got a few thousand students coming
in the next week, and many of them will need advising help in selecting
their courses (although most are supposed to have registered back in
March). So this is an info meeting to advise the advisers! Here our
hilarious, affable, pastoral Provost Dennis Jameson is giving his report
from the Office of the Provost. He managed to make it all the way
through without making fun of Saskatchewan! :)
