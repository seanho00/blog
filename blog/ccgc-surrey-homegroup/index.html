            <p>Tonight the Surrey small group of CCGC invited me to come share a bit
about time management with the kids, and it was so much fun to hang out
with these dozen or so wonderful, energetic, hilarious, surprising,
insightful kids! Once again I underestimated how bright and intelligent
the kids are; I must apologize! Since nearly half the kids were fairly
new and didn't usually attend the small group, I figured that we'd need
a few songs and games to break the ice a bit. But I think the ice had
already been smashed to smithereens by the time the kids were bouncing
off the walls! :) They got much more engaged and focused once we got
into the "meat" of things when I explained <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;&amp;search=1Cor9:23-27">I Corinthians
9:23-27</a>
-- living with purpose and making the most of our short time on earth.
They totally surprised me with their terrific and very deep questions:
is Jesus the only way, what about other religions? What about people
who've never done anything bad but just don't believe in Jesus? What
about First Nations people or other groups that might never have heard
about Jesus? Is there an "unforgivable sin", and what does that mean? So
much excitement and interest and wonderful questions -- we ran longer
than the parents in the next room! I should have gotten into the
Scripture earlier and left more time for questions; sorry guys!</p>
<p>Afterward, during the snacks, I stayed even longer to chat and have some
informal Q&amp;A time with the parents -- and that was quite rewarding, too,
to see these parents who care so much about their kids, and not just
about their marks in school or what instruments they played, but about
their happiness, emotional growth, and spiritual status. Many of them
observed that their kids are so mind-numbingly bored in school, they end
up becoming trouble-makers -- yep, I was like that, too! But I am happy
to see these parents taking responsibility for their own kids' education
rather than leaving it in the hands of the schools. They are all good
kids -- bright and talented and compassionate and analytical and
expressive! The prayer, and the task, is to channel their interests into
serving others to bring glory to God who created us and loves us. It's
an interesting feeling now that I'm closer in age to the parents than I
am to the kids; I really empathize with their heartache and the
emotional ups and downs that come with parenthood!</p>
<p>This grab-shot was taken during the snack time, an impromptu performance
by our ten-year-old virtuoso violinist, Lucy! She's super-cute and so
energetic! :) She played some Vivaldi, and here she's playing an
Oriental-sounding piece unfamiliar to me; it was highly technical, with
lots of tricky intervals and slides. She's a real child prodigy, and
more importantly, she's using her gifts to glorify God!</p>
