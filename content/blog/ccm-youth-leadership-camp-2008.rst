This weekend was Chinese Christian Mission's third annual youth
leadership camp! As with last year, they invited back the same no-name,
two-bit, non-credentialed guest speaker (me). As with two years ago,
they returned to the same location at the lovely but rustic Camp Jubilee
-- a 20-minute boat ride away from Deep Cove. But this year, we had a
dramatic increase in kids, nearly 50 of us total at the camp! The kids
were enthusiastic and wonderfully silly, and one of the most
oft-repeated comments was about all the terrific new friendships they've
forged at camp.
