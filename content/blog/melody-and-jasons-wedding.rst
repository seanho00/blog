Yay, our friends Melody and Jason at Surrey ECBC got married today! They
are both so sweet and gentle, with such fervent hearts to serve the
Lord. It is so wonderful that both of them are from Christian families;
that came through in the course of the whole wedding day, in the focus
on worshipping God and giving Him all the glory. I thought it was
veryÂ \ *pure*, without any taint of the awkward weird partying that
often accompanies non-Christian weddings. It reflects a simple
child-like faith and a heritage of following the Lord. I found
particularly touching the slideshow presentation at the reception
banquet: the story of how Jason+Melody met and fell in love seemed so
simple and straightforward, with relatively little angst -- truly a
match brought about by Christ.

Here's the happy couple with me and Esther, Pastor Larry's wife -- we
were the only two people from VCAC there who know Melody+Jason! Esther
was Melody's roomie at TWU.
