I can't resist including this lovely picture from this afternoon! After
everyone was napped and well-fed with dinner, we had lots of energy to
run around in the backyard, playing with bubbles and picking these
little white and pink flowers. Is she not just the most adorable thing
in the whole world? :)Â Of course, I might be just a wee bit biased....
