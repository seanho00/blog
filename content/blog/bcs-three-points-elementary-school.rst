I was down in Seattle this weekend for a quick visit to see old
friends \ `(photos in separate
album) <http://photo.seanho.com/2006-11_Chris_Tomlin>`__. Saturday
afternoon, I had a little bit of spare time in the neighborhood, so on a
whim I stopped by \ `my old elementary
school <http://bellevuechristian.org/>`__. Nobody was around, but it was
still so cool to be reminded of old memories: it's been nearly twenty
years since I was last here. We used to hide out inside these truck
tires; they still smell the same. I once wore my winter jacket every day
to school for a whole school year -- just to prove to myself that I
could do it! So peculiar....

My old sixth-grade teacher, Mr. Downs, is apparently still teaching; his
name is still above one of the doors. As I walked down the corridor past
the classrooms, I was reminded of just how precious a solid, Bible-based
Christian education is, especially for the impressionable primary-school
years!
