After Pastor Larry's wedding, I went for bubble tea by myself to think
and pray for a bit, then met up with Steve and Tyrone for pitch-n-putt
at Central Park. It was my first time ever playing any golf that wasn't
mini-golf, but this course is pretty easy and was a gentle introduction
to golf for me. Apparently it's called "pitch-n-putt" because the holes
are all par 3, so a "normal" golfer should be able to "pitch" onto the
green in one drive, then sink the ball into the hole with a couple
putts. Here I am still in my wedding clothes, carrying my rental 7-iron
and putter; Steve is behind me.
