            <p>This is my workplace, at TWU -- only this weekend I'm here in my
alter-ego capacity as speaker for the CCGC joint youth leadership
retreat! Teaching math and computers is just my cover to protect my
secret identity of preaching the gospel! :)</p>
<p>The CCGC kids are always so sweet and loving whenever they greet me;
it's so heartwarming to see them! I credit all the love Auntie Doris
(far right, in pink) has poured out on them over the years; she really
has a mothering heart for those kids.Â <a class="reference external" href="/2006/ccgc-youth-tent-camping">The
past</a> <a class="reference external" href="/2007/ccgc-teens-on-the-bus">two
years</a>, they've brought me to their
annual youth tent camping trips to speak -- and it's real tent camping,
no electricity, just gravel clearings and outhouses (though there are
faucets with clean running water). The first year, I had to give my
Sunday sermon twice, once in each tent, because it was pouring rain and
all the kids were huddled in two leaky tents! Lots of fun! :)</p>
<p>This year, the weekend they'd selected for their tent camping trip, I
had already been booked by <a class="reference external" href="/2008/jar-of-doom-at-ecbc-youth-camp">ECBC's youth
camp</a>, so their camping trip
was organized by a group of young people who came all the way from Texas
to use this as their short-term missions trip. Pastor Lo still wanted a
retreat with me in it, though, so he set up a special weekend of
leadership training, only for baptized believers, only for those who
after a full weekend of tent-camping fun still wanted more depth, more
challenge, and more time with God.</p>
<p>These are kids who really have a heart to serve, who want to impact
their youth group and their schools for God, and who want to grow closer
to Christ. And it shows in their spirit and attitude! I found the
atmosphere quite different from other, larger, camps where a significant
fraction of kids are non-Christians or "nominal" Christians. Yes, they
still got crazy silly insane sometimes, rolling 15 kids into a group
hug, or abusing the Canadian national anthem in Mandarin, or switching
lunchtime topics seamlessly between chucking woodchucks and
Israeli-Palestinian relations and electron orbitals. If anything, I
think they felt free to be even more silly, because there was this real
family bond in Christ. But under it all is that unshakable kernel of
faith, knowing that Jesus has called them to be living sacrifices for
His glory, living lives transformed by the power of God. It was so
powerful and heartwarming just to see the kids in the morning, spread
out on the campus lawns, each one earnestly enjoying their personal
devotion quiet time! Woo hoo! :)</p>
<p>Many kudos go to the U.S. team of four college kids -- Casey, C.T.,
Andy, and Sarah -- for really taking the teens under their wing these
two months! This weekend's retreat was all organized by them, with small
groups, games, singing, "GIG" (Growing in God) workshops, and more. I
just dropped in for the three main messages; they did most of the real
work! Oh, and Sarah (kneeling in front on the far left) had this great
idea of putting in a whole week's worth of daily devotions into the
retreat handbook, for the kids to do after they get home from camp!
Great follow-up idea!</p>
