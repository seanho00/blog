My parents have been in town for the past two weeks, speaking at a few
churches in the area, but they'll be leaving again soon, so we went out
for dinner at this delicious little Korean place in Walnut Grove, close
by my place. The first time I set foot in here two years ago, I noticed
that it was packed -- with nearly all Korean people! Good sign! The
spices can be a little strong, but it's quite yummy. I once took home a
small tupperware of leftover sauce, and diluted it to flavour meals for
the rest of the week!
