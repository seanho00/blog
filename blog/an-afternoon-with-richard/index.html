            <p>Ah, another refreshing, unplanned Sunday afternoon! It always amazes me
how quickly church empties after worship service and Sunday School --
within half an hour the foyer at KS is pretty much empty, save for those
who have meetings or other responsibilities. What ever happened to
church as a family, being deliberately un-busy for each other, spending
time together even when we don't "have" to? Ah well.</p>
<p>So I figured, hey, I'm free to explore around town a bit on my own for
lunch! This time I didn't go quite as far as <a class="reference external" href="/2006/ferry-at-horseshoe-bay">Horseshoe
Bay</a>, just around UBC and back into the
Kitsilano area. After lunch, while strolling down Broadway, I noticed
this cute little bookshop, and something inside me nudged me to go in.
It's been probably a dozen years since I've set foot in a real
mom-and-pop bookstore, not a mega Borders or Barnes&amp;Noble. It was so
quiet inside, and I spent about ten minutes browsing through their
classics shelf before I heard the word "Gnostic" from behind a few
shelves away.</p>
<p>A man's voice was asking the shopkeeper, "Do you know anything about
these Gnostics?"</p>
<p>"Nah, I ... I really don't know much about them", replied the young
college girl, as she continued filing away books. I started to wonder if
God had had a reason for me to visit this particular bookshop.</p>
<p>The man persisted, "I'm really wondering what they're about: if what
these Gnostics are saying is true, then that really changes everything
about Christianity!"</p>
<p>I had an internal struggle -- should I strike up a conversation? Listen
more? Quietly walk out? Maybe he would just drop the subject, and then I
could continue browsing in peace without the guilt of having "shirked my
duty" -- after all, we shouldn't be judgmental or confrontational,
right?</p>
<p>"So you don't know anything about Gnosticism? 'Cause man, if these guys
are right, ..."</p>
<p>My curiousity finally overcame me. Slowly coming around the bookshelf, I
saw the inquirer: a thin, gangly man in his upper forties, with short,
scruffy grey facial hair, sitting on a chair with his legs tucked under
him like a teenager. He exhibited that geeky, quirky chic of someone
who's lived alone with his own rules for many years. I made eye contact,
then slowly started describing the Gnostic religion and its unique
beliefs.</p>
<p>Once I got to the mystic <em>gnosis</em> and the Archons, I could tell he was
getting really confused -- and that's when I finally noticed the
paperback in his hands: "The Gnostic Gospels". Ah, that really has
nothing to do with the Gnostics ... and more to do with "The DaVinci
Code". I gave a bit of background on the Gnostic 'gospels' and how very
different they are from canon.</p>
<p>He fired back, "But Jesus claimed his was the <em>only</em> way -- what a
power grab! And, '<em>here</em> are my chosen disciples' -- how convenient for
them, so they can setup this hierarchy!"</p>
<p>Yes, religion over the centuries has often misused Scripture in order to
position human leaders as intermediaries between people and God -- but
Jesus came to abolish that and give us direct access to God, through
himself.</p>
<p>"But Jesus is the <em>only</em> way? Uh-uh! OK, maybe I'll grant that Jesus
was sent from God, but I'll<em>never</em> accept that he's the only way!"</p>
<p>We spent the next hour in deep discussion: me leaning against a
bookshelf, a paperback in hand; him on the chair, constantly shifting
positions, half getting up, now pulling his legs under him, now bouncing
his knee -- evidently incredulous and deeply disturbed by my responses
and by the claims of Scripture.</p>
<p>He asked me, "How can you believe in a Creator? Don't you believe in
evolution, ape-man, and all that?"</p>
<p>So I launched into an explanation of the second law of thermodynamics,
information theory, and creation as originally "very good". I was
part-way through describing Java Man when he stopped me mid-sentence:</p>
<p>"Hold on here, let me just ask you this."</p>
<p>Okay....</p>
<p>"Are you for real?"</p>
<p>:) Heh, I had to laugh a bit at that -- yes, I'm very much for real!</p>
<p>"So you believe in Adam and Eve?!"</p>
<p>Yes sir, I do. Consider just one aspect, population -- before the advent
of antibiotics, the world population was doubling about every 125-150
years. Even with occasional epidemics like the bubonic plague,
extrapolating back from our current population of 6 billion, we get to
two people in just a few thousand years.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">"Adam and Eve!?" He got up, all the way this time, and turned away
from me.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">"But they're just fairy tales! This is the new millenium, man! You're
educated; even if I weren't educated, I still wouldn't believe in
them!"</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I gently reminded him of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: "When you have
eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be
the truth". But he was overcome with incredulity, and finally walked out
to leave the bookshop. I momentarily regretted not having asked his
name, so that I could continue to pray for him, but just as he opened
the door, by God's providence, another store employee called after him,
"Take care, Richard!"</p>
<p>What an energizing and joyful experience to have the chance to talk with
a random stranger about Jesus! Thank you, Lord, for this divine
appointment: for bringing me to Kitsilano, to this bookshop, and to this
man Richard. I may never get another chance to see him on this earth,
but may Your Word and Your love strike his heart powerfully: disturb
him, shake him, until he finds that there is no peace without Jesus.</p>
<p><em>(Postscript:)</em> I had stayed quite long in the little bookshop, so it
was only reasonable that I purchase the paperback I'd been holding.
While ringing me up, the college girl laughed, "So after all that, the
book you're getting is 'Jane Eyre'?" :) OK, that and Plato's "Republic".
"That's more like it!"</p>
