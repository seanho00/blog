One of the complications of being a US citizen living in Canada is that
I need to get permanent residency status, and there's an awful lot of
paperwork involved. Fortunately, TWU contracted an immigration lawyer to
help me out, but the whole thing is still very confusing to me. Today I
got my fingerprints taken at a local RCMP station; we'll send them in to
the FBI to get a criminal background check. I don't think anything will
turn up! :)Â I did find it interesting that the fingerprint forms aren't
merely the usual ten finger tips, but also imprints of your four fingers
together, and your thumb, extending down to the 2nd and 1st phalanges.
