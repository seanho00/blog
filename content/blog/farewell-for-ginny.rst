Ginny is one of the trio of girls at Fraserlands we affectionately call
"MSG"; she was one of the first to welcome me the very first time I
visited this church back in 2005. She's always been very honest and
forthright, stable and mature, sometimes acerbic but always empathetic!
We wish her all the best as she leaves her hometown and flies off to her
new job in Calgary!
