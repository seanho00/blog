no excuse; we simply did not push ourselves hard enough to write.
 Besides Sean’s ministry and part-time job, we spend our free time
talking, napping, cooking (me) and eating (Sean and me), or just
moseying around the house.  We have a lot of fun together and are amazed
at the endless entertainment that we bring to each other in our ordinary
daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean manages his own invitations and ministry schedule.  After he
confirms an invitation, he has the good habit of putting it on Google
Calendar.   In order for me to know where I am going each Sunday, I have
to look up his calendar on Google from time to time and copy it to my
phone’s calendar.  (I have no direct access to his computer or cell
phone – he takes gadget security seriously – he uses strong passwords or
his fingerprint.)  So, yesterday I was doing just that.  As I flipped to
October, I noticed this entry on Oct 21: “engagement”.  I confessed I
grumbled when I saw it.  I mean, who holds an engagement party on a
weekday?  (Weird.)  Who invited Sean but not me?  (How rude!)  Is Sean
going to a party without telling me?!  (Is this an old flame?  But he
has long insisted that he had none.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I scratched my head and started to poke around other entries to find
clues..   After about 10 minutes, my smarts seemed to come back – wait,
when did I get engaged?  I tried to recall.  Oh yes, we got engaged on
Oct 21, 2008!  Oh, so THIS is MY engagement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then promptly forgot about the above until today.  I was thinking
about our blog and came here to see what we had written, and I saw the
word “engagement” in an old entry.  Before I forgot about it again, I
ran upstairs to the study and told Sean about it.  “Duh,” he laughed,
“It is YOUR engagement.”  He went on, “You will see ‘anniversary’ on May
23 on the calendar next year.  It is YOUR wedding anniversary, silly
pie.”  “Oh… yeah… I will remember that!”  (I did twice forget about my
previous anniversaries!)  And we just laughed and hugged and laughed
some more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yup, so here, we finally wrote a blog entry after a long hiatus.  This
also commemorates our 3-year-engagement-anniversary, yes.  And I do hope
I can write more blog entries about Sean, who also has no shortage of
funny stories on his forgetfulness.  I promise I will write them down
if/when I recall these moments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Photo: Sean on our engagement day]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a loud hissing sound in the background, I stood in the middle of
the kitchen, stunned, and helplessly watched two high-pressure steams
from the pressure cooker, spraying everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what I was thinking -- I popped open the release valve  on
my pressure cooker when it had been cooking on "high" for 20
minutes.  Now I KNOW the power of a pressure cooker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the eruption (and I) calmed down, I started to count my blessings:
(1) I was cooking bean soup and not chicken soup hence it was relatively
easier to clean, (2) the trajectories of the two hot steams were aiming
slightly besides me and not toward me, and (3) this was a great
opportunity to thoroughly clean up the kitchen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, so with thankfulness in my heart, I washed everything from dishes to
pots, stove to appliances, and wall to floor!  It took us a whole day to
reasonably tidy up the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mess -- it reminded me of the "bird bombs" that our study sustained
back in April. In April, our condo complex had a fire, and it destroyed
our neighbours' homes. Fortunately, our condo suffered no damage.
Nevertheless, the firefighters still came to our house to spray foam in
our attic, accessible through the ceiling in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firefighters left without closing up the attic, and we were not
allowed to return to the house for three days.  After we came back from
our impromptu-mini-vacation and entered the study, we were greeted by a
new post-modern painting -- with bird poop as the paint, and the room as
the canvas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bird must have flown into the attic through the burned-down condo,
and when she saw the light from our room, she flew toward the light but
got trapped inside.  Out of either happiness or panic, she pooped
everywhere –- soft, slushy drops splashed on the wall, desk, computer,
and things in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awww… we forgot to take pictures of these disasters for the viewing
pleasure our readers!  In the bird bomb case, I immediately rolled my
sleeves and started to clean up.  In the pressure cooker case, I was too
shocked to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I finally finished cleaning and just collapsed on the
couch by Sean, who buried himself in his work, as usual.  I had this
strange thought, "some photos of these disasters would have captured the
fun of my domestic life."  And so I murmured, "hmm… too bad it is
impossible to replicate these disastrous scenes for some good picture
memories…."  To this, Sean immediately sprang his head from his computer
and firmly said, "oh, no, never again!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is officially our first Thanksgiving dinner at home with just
the two of us!  Last year was our first Thanksgiving as a married
couple, but we spent the long weekend on a little road trip -- we did
have turkey, but that year it was store-bought from the nearby Safeway.
 This year, my dear wifey has industriously prepared this lovely 8-lb
turkey all by herself -- stuffed with celery, carrots, onions, and bay
leaves for flavour -- carefully basted, and cooked to perfection!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In front we've got steamed corn-on-the-cob, baked sweet-potato
home-fries, her new fresh-from-scratch cranberry/peach sauce, and two
(store-bought) rolls.  Behind the turkey are some fresh salad greens in
a nifty stoneware bowl that she recently picked up, of Peruvian design
(ah, but still made in China!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and in the back on our little glass-top dining table, that's my
addition -- my little gardenia plant, I'm so proud that it survived the
summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postscript:&lt;/em&gt; Dear Wifey wishes me to add her Thanksgiving leftover tip:
she made use of the leftover cranberry sauce and some fresh lemon zest
to make lemon-cranberry muffins -- no food wasted here!&lt;/p&gt;

God had
called us to get married, and so we said yes to God and to each other.
The future was full of uncertainties, but we knew through our past life
experiences that God had never forsaken us as long as we walked in the
centre of His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we asked God to give us love. As God’s love poured out into our
hearts, our love for each other deepened everyday. During our engagement
period, we only got to see each other once or twice a week. Since we
lived on opposite sides of town, we tried to meet at a central location,
usually at the parking lot of some strip mall. When we saw each other,
we’d just run toward each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years after the engagement, we still run toward each other whenever
we are reunited after a day’s work or time apart. As we come back to and
rest in each other, peace and consolation would fill our hearts and
quiet us down, as worries, stress, and tiredness of the world strangely
fade away. Marriage is a little foretaste of Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, being marriage-minded does not come naturally to me. By God’s
grace I am gaining a deeper understanding of God’s unrelenting,
forgiving, and selfless love, as well as man’s innate rebellion toward
God and His decrees. Marriage is a perpetual training camp where I learn
and live out God’s definition of love as in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1cor13:4-8&amp;amp;version=NASB"&gt;1 Corinthians
13&lt;/a&gt;.
It is also where God moulds my character to do His current and future
work. I do not know about the future work; the only thing that’s
required of me in this regard is obedience. But I do know about the
current work – it is my daily walk with God – to be moulded by Him and
to be a helpmate for Sean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean and I are both insistent. We stubbornly commit to our marriage
(because God said so), just like how we have stubbornly followed Jesus
our Father, Lord, and Saviour. And just like how we run toward each
other in love, we are daily running to God with reckless abandon. This
is life; this is what we do. We just want to run, run, and run toward
the arms of our Heavenly Father until the day that we finally see Him,
when we can find our eternal rest and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They
do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a
crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like a man
running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. No,
I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached
to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:25-27&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;I Corinthians
9:25-27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've grown used to these faculty retreats now: this is how we start off
each school year, giving us a chance to connect with other faculty
across different disciplines, and bringing us back into the swing of the
Fall semester after a summer of pursuing our own research interests.
It's a nice gesture to have a little getaway, and I know the organizing
committees (composed of fellow faculty like ourselves) work hard at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, though, I can't help but feel like I'm physically present but
mentally absent.  I'm not enthralled by the talks like I was in years
past; I can't relate with the small talk from my colleagues, and even
the appeal of the beautiful natural surroundings has diminished for me
somewhat.  Maybe it's me; maybe I'm being unappreciative of what God's
given me.  Or maybe this is just no longer my scene, I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss my dear wifey; I would love to bring her here to walk along the
lake or through the surrounding forest.  I feel I am unable to enjoy it
fully without her; she is a part of me!&lt;/p&gt;

Well,
the "big news" from the last post to this blog back in 2008 was that I
got engaged! And in the words of one of my friends: "a fiancée?! When
did you have a girlfriend?" Yes, it was all very whirlwind-romance, God
swept us both off our feet! The full story is available for those who
are interested, but the short of it is, when God called us, the calling
was very clear -- the only question left was whether we would obey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that my life is not just one person but two, I have to be
careful about what I post on here! She is very reluctant to have her
photo on the web -- understandably so, given my somewhat high-profile
life! Did I mention the time my dad was in some random town in China and
a young man whom he'd never met before showed him his cellphone -- with
&lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; family photo as his wallpaper? Who puts someone &lt;em&gt;else's&lt;/em&gt; family on
their cellphone?! Soooo spooky....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my DW (dear wifey) and I have been talking about getting this blog
started again, so this is just a welcome back to everyone! The photo and
date of posting are from our wedding day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings to you all! Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

This is our first wedding in our TGIF youth/young-adults' fellowship,

Jason and Karen are such a terrific couple together; they are both
stable and mature Christians, and super-cute together! They had their
fair share of trials while planning for the wedding, but by God's grace
they came through together, Jason and his "Special-K"! (or, as he called
her during wedding preparations, KIC -- "Karen In Charge"!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sanctuary at SCAC is also gorgeous for a wedding, with all the
lovely stone granite flooring and stately columns, lavish chandeliers

for staff and faculty at Trinity. It's a time when we get back together
after a summer of working on our own separate projects; some faculty
have been away on travel studies, or sabbatical, or just doing their own
research. Sessional faculty only work 9 months out of the year, so it's
their time to come back on campus. For me, my summer has been
full-up-to-the-brim with the ministry work -- I'm kind of looking
forward to the school year for a reprieve! :) Well, maybe it won't be
less hectic, but at least it's a bit more predictable....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community Day is always cool because it's essentially a worship service
for all the staff/faculty, all five or six hundred of us. This year, we
borrowed the sanctuary at Langley Christian Reformed Church; it was just
beautiful and really set me in a worshipful mood. Even the upward sweep
of the big pipe organ seemed to uplift our spirits in reverence. I came
in late and had to stand in the balcony stairwell, but still I
thoroughly enjoyed the time of worship.&lt;/p&gt;

actually took an afternoon nap in my car, because the ground-floor
garage is the coolest place in my house!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for dinner tonight, rather than getting even warmer by cooking at
home, we decided to go out and try this new swanky restaurant along
200th, Waterhouse Grill. It was on the more upscale side of things, but
not overly pricey, compared with, say, Coza's Tuscan in Langley. The
beef brisket was superb. I liked the architecture and decor, although

(Or is it the sixth?) This
retreat was a bit impromptu -- Pastor Ho from Coquitlam ECBC spots me by
chance at Surrey ECBC, pulls me aside and quickly asks if I could be
their youth speaker at "our camp". Well, from hard experience I know
that many small churches tend to confuse being a guest youth speaker
with being the resident youth retreat coordinator -- and if a church
asks you to come "take care of the kids", oh boy, watch out! I once made
the mistake of accepting an invitation like that -- I got to the camp,
and was essentially told, "Here's twenty kids between the ages of 12 and
24, see you in three days!". Hah! We had a lot of fun anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, ECBC is no small church, with a total Sunday attendance of over a
thousand just at the main Burnaby campus. But there was no reply about
what kind of camp this was going to be -- was it for the Surrey
congregation? Coquitlam? Combined? English? Bilingual? Just youth? I
just knew it was going to be at Cedar Springs (beautiful, but small, so
surely the whole church wouldn't be there). And I guessed that it was
mostly the Mandarin congregation from Burnaby. So I brought my guitar
and came prepared for an exciting surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was the annual family camp of Burnaby campus -- which I
would have imagined would be big. But because many fellowships have
their own camps (I just spoke at their big youth camp last month, 120
teens), not everyone comes to this one. They also had this interesting
requirement that the parents come with the teens -- so no kids were
there by themselves. This implicitly meant that most of the kids there
came from Christian households -- and that dramatically changed the
atmosphere in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a group of about twenty teens, wonderful sweet kids, many recent
immigrants, such that a number were actually more comfortable in
Mandarin than in English. So we sang a couple Streams of Praise songs in
addition to the usual, and I got to practise my Mandarin a lot! Yes,
many things were improvised on the spot -- the first night, we had no
laptop or projector (nor, indeed, song leader), so the kids wrote up
lyrics on a whiteboard from memory! It was great, because we could write
up a Chinese song on the whiteboard, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the hectic scrambling, I had a warm, innocent -- and yes,
peaceful -- time with these precious kids, and with good friends amongst
the Timothy fellowship young adults. A big thanks to Esther and Sarah
for helping me out with the kids -- they also were asked last-minute,
only a week before the camp!&lt;/p&gt;

They'll be getting
married this September at Fraser Lands; we're all excited for them! In
my eyes, they've always exemplified the childlike faith that Christ
calls us to have, a very pure, unshakeable faith and an earnest thirst
for God. They are both very caring and empathetic -- and exceedingly
cute together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today they had their "Jack and Jill" party -- kind of a combined
bachelor/bachelorette party. In the first part of the evening we had
separate guys/girls activities (I use the term "activities" loosely for
the guys -- mostly we just hung out on the couch, ate chips, and watched
sports on TV!). Then the girls joined us and we had some embarrassing
games for the couple, and plenty of food and mixing to be had all
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so glad to be there for this "Jack and Jill" party, to celebrate
with Jason+Connie, particularly because I won't be able to make it to
their actual wedding. I would have loved to be there for them to lead
songs at the wedding, but Dan's wedding in NC is the same day, and Dan
has subtly threatened me with organized crime syndicates from two
countries if I don't come to his wedding! :)&lt;/p&gt;

What a happy celebration it is; from
start to finish I don't think Bob was ever able to wipe that huge grin
off his face! It's also truly a testimony of God's faithfulness and
grace that brought the two of them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jayne's happy but a bit nervous, you can tell. Everything went quite
smoothly, but it's a pretty big deal to her family and friends. Jayne's
a PK/MK, and her parents have a lot of connections in Vancouver. I think
over 600 people must have been crammed in the KS sanctuary. Her parents
got married in this very sanctuary, decades ago! And as the first of her
siblings to get married, she had a fair bit of pressure in the
wedding-planning stages. Her dad was the one to officiate, but they also
had a "word of exhortation" from Pastor John, who had done their
pre-marital counselling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the ceremony was beautiful and worshipful, and I really
enjoyed it from my front-row seat. I especially appreciated that Jayne
specifically wanted their wedding to be a worship service with the
gospel clearly communicated, for the sake of Bob's relatives and their
friends and coworkers who were not Christians. It was such a privilege
for me to lead worship for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also ridiculously cool, albeit a bit head-spinning, to catch up
again with lots of old KS/FL friends, some of whom I hadn't seen in over
a year. Even from KS, which nominally is my "home church" now, there
were many friends and aunties/uncles whom I hadn't seen in a long time
-- ever since the ministry opportunities have really accelerated in the
past couple years, I haven't had a chance to be back at KS but once
every month or two. It's good to be back, but I think I'm happier and
have a broader and more sober perspective on the church issues at KS now
that I have my ministries elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

album!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend did have one shadow cast on it for me, although I suppose I
shouldn't have dwelt on it so much (and thanks Jon for chastening me
about that!). Friday night at the rehearsal dinner I happened to meet
for the first time and sit next to a well-known, long-time lay leader in
her past churches, prominent in the children's ministry. With that
common interest in children's and youth ministries, we struck up a
conversation about the need for whole-family outreach, with the
children's workers coordinating in tandem with the adult ministries that
can reach the parents. So far, so good. She talked about how so many of
the kids carry emotional hurts and pent-up anger and don't know how to
deal with it. Agreed! How all they need is to identify and express their
emotions, and they'll be able to heal themselves from there; they have
the power within themselves. Uhh, hold on a sec. She went on further
about self-actualization, reflecting some of the common thinking and
terminology I've seen in contemporary secular psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I've noticed this as a trend -- an alarming amount of pop psychology
making its way into the second-generation, CBC/ABC church. How everyone
has a voice (which is true), and all they need to find healing is to
express it (which is not true). How bottling up anger hurts oneself
(which is true), so hence one needs to vent it (which is not true). I
expect to see this kind of thinking in the secular world, but I am
sorely devastated to see it infiltrating the church. I was so incredibly
disappointed and sad, I had a hard time maintaining a conversation with
her; we kind of "agreed to disagree". It is important to "know thyself",
indeed, and to recognize emotional hurts, anger, bitterness. But it is
not sufficient simply to recognize, we also need to change. Where we are
is not where we should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liken it to the difference between &lt;em&gt;confession&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;repentance&lt;/em&gt;
(in modern-day usage; I think Scriptural usage assumes we understand the
two are inseparable). In today's language, confession means admitting
I'm wrong. But repentance involves turning away from sin and back toward
God. If I am perpetually angry, yes, I need to recognize that. But it's
not enough just to say, "I'm angry, that's the way I am" -- I need to
change, for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=James1:20"&gt;"the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of
God" (James
1:20)&lt;/a&gt;.
And the claim of Scripture is that we do not have the power within
ourselves to change; indeed, apart from Christ we &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=jn15:5"&gt;"can do nothing"
(John
15:5)&lt;/a&gt;.
This is why Christ died for us; this is why for all of man's problems --
addictions, self-image issues, family issues, failing marriages, angry
kids -- the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; real solution is Jesus Christ himself.&lt;/p&gt;

alter-ego capacity as speaker for the CCGC joint youth leadership
retreat! Teaching math and computers is just my cover to protect my
secret identity of preaching the gospel! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CCGC kids are always so sweet and loving whenever they greet me;
it's so heartwarming to see them! I credit all the love Auntie Doris
(far right, in pink) has poured out on them over the years; she really
has a mothering heart for those kids. &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/ccgc-youth-tent-camping"&gt;The
past&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/ccgc-teens-on-the-bus"&gt;two
years&lt;/a&gt;, they've brought me to their
annual youth tent camping trips to speak -- and it's real tent camping,
no electricity, just gravel clearings and outhouses (though there are
faucets with clean running water). The first year, I had to give my
Sunday sermon twice, once in each tent, because it was pouring rain and
all the kids were huddled in two leaky tents! Lots of fun! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the weekend they'd selected for their tent camping trip, I
had already been booked by &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2008/jar-of-doom-at-ecbc-youth-camp"&gt;ECBC's youth
camp&lt;/a&gt;, so their camping trip
was organized by a group of young people who came all the way from Texas
to use this as their short-term missions trip. Pastor Lo still wanted a
retreat with me in it, though, so he set up a special weekend of
leadership training, only for baptized believers, only for those who
after a full weekend of tent-camping fun still wanted more depth, more
challenge, and more time with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are kids who really have a heart to serve, who want to impact
their youth group and their schools for God, and who want to grow closer
to Christ. And it shows in their spirit and attitude! I found the
atmosphere quite different from other, larger, camps where a significant
fraction of kids are non-Christians or "nominal" Christians. Yes, they
still got crazy silly insane sometimes, rolling 15 kids into a group
hug, or abusing the Canadian national anthem in Mandarin, or switching
lunchtime topics seamlessly between chucking woodchucks and
Israeli-Palestinian relations and electron orbitals. If anything, I
think they felt free to be even more silly, because there was this real
family bond in Christ. But under it all is that unshakable kernel of
faith, knowing that Jesus has called them to be living sacrifices for
His glory, living lives transformed by the power of God. It was so
powerful and heartwarming just to see the kids in the morning, spread
out on the campus lawns, each one earnestly enjoying their personal
devotion quiet time! Woo hoo! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many kudos go to the U.S. team of four college kids -- Casey, C.T.,
Andy, and Sarah -- for really taking the teens under their wing these
two months! This weekend's retreat was all organized by them, with small
groups, games, singing, "GIG" (Growing in God) workshops, and more. I
just dropped in for the three main messages; they did most of the real
work! Oh, and Sarah (kneeling in front on the far left) had this great
idea of putting in a whole week's worth of daily devotions into the
retreat handbook, for the kids to do after they get home from camp!
Great follow-up idea!&lt;/p&gt;

And for me, 'tis the age when every
year a lot of my friends all get married up! Today it was Vivien and
Richard from KS. They are such a sweet, quiet couple; I always see them
hiding out in the balcony at KS, holding hands. They're always pleasant
and peaceable, soft-spoken and never ones to draw attention to
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's ceremony at Fraser Lands, officiated by Pastor Lawrence, was
sparse and simple, which I thought kind of reflected their aversion to
pomp and ceremony. It was fairly small, less than 200 people I think; I
would have thought more people from church would be there. In this photo

aisle, she had this &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; grin on her face, it was fantastically
hilarious! :)&lt;/p&gt;

friend (posted with permission!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will you explain more on "guarding your heart"? After I came back
from the camp, I have been spending time with my friend who has been
bothered, in my opinion, by this "heart" thing. Her heart led her to
take certain actions that later she regretted or she found she made
a mess. Tonight another girl friend told me that her heart also led
to make a major decision. Yes, I agree it is important for us to
guard our hearts, but how? it is not easy in real life. We,
especially the non-teenage we, are very good at deceiving ourselves
with justifiable reasons too. How will you respond to these friends
of mine?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, these are some tricky issues that prompt us to draw closer to
Christ for wisdom and discernment. I certainly can't speak to your
friends' particular situations, not knowing the details, but hopefully I
can encourage you with some general pointers from Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumptions: I assume that your friend is looking toward marriage,
serious about a relationship -- at this age, we are (or should be) past
the point of casual flings. Also, I assume that she wishes to honour God
foremost in life -- if your friend is not a Christian, then we might
take a different approach with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;&amp;amp;search=gen2:24"&gt;Genesis
2:24&lt;/a&gt;
God makes the first marriage, defining and ordaining it for generations
to come. Both Adam and Eve's roles in the ordination of this marriage
are relatively passive -- e.g., Adam was asleep! (Sometimes it seems
like most guys are pretty much asleep when it comes to relationships,
too! ;) ) It was God who brought them together; they did not seek each
other out. Of course, they did have freewill, and each had a role to
play -- on Adam's part, the moment he saw her he was bowled over, and
took her in as "flesh of his own flesh". Scripture does not describe
what Eve said, but she certainly accepted Adam's "proposal". They acted
in response to God's call and ordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that I believe God is the one who ordains marriage, and as
in any life decision, who to pursue is something we must offer up to
God, to seek His direction and submit to His will. Yes, God created us
as emotional beings, and marriage should be an emotional connection in
addition to a spiritual connection, but simply to "follow your
heart" can lead one to rash and selfish decisions. Scripture says that
"the heart is deceitful above all things", but "the LORD searches the
heart" &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jer17:9-10"&gt;(Jeremiah
17:9-10)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of how emotions can lead us astray is Samson in Judges 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Then Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah, one of
the daughters of the Philistines. So he came back and told his
father and mother, "I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters
of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jdg14:1-2"&gt;(Judges
14:1-2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samson had no regard for the fact that the Philistines worshipped false
idols, that they were in fact enemies of the Israelites at the time; he
just said, "I like her, I want her, get her for me as a wife." So many
Christians do the same thing today. I warn the teenage and young-adult
guys that I speak to, don't go out with a girl just because she
makes your eyes happy -- that's being selfish. How many times do we tell
God, "God, I really like him/her; now please bless this relationship!"?
We've already made the decision, and now we just want God to
rubber-stamp it. Now, it's not wrong to ask our loving Father for His
blessing, but it's much more important that we ask Him for His advice
and guidance &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; we get emotionally invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean that we need to switch off our emotions and become
robots, but it does mean that we need to submit our emotions to the will
of Christ, to seek Him first. The LORD does want to "give you the
desires of your heart", but the prerequisite is that you "delight
yourself in the LORD" &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps37:4"&gt;(Psalm
37:4)&lt;/a&gt;. Do we
really believe that God alone is able to fill all of our loneliness and
need? Do we really believe that if we had nothing else in the whole
world -- no spouse, no kids, no family -- that just having Jesus is
enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things
will be added to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt6:33"&gt;(Matthew
6:33)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what becomes of dating, then? How are we supposed to find a mate --
everyone just take a nap like Adam did, and hope for the best? :) No, I
think there is a place for building deep friendships and having honest,
open conversations with brothers and sisters in Christ. But, in my
experience at least, when we approach these conversations with the
primary goal of "hunting down" a mate, the high expectations strain the
fledgling relationship and often squash what could otherwise be a
valuable friendship. It may send the guy running for the hills; it may
raise the girl's "desperate creep" warning flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice, to both guys and girls? (Disclaimer: giving advice and living
it are two different things; I'm still struggling with these issues
myself!) I say, first and foremost, pursue God's calling for your life
ministry with reckless abandon. Is God calling you to marketplace
ministry? Kids' ministry? Counsellor to the teenage girls in the youth
group? One-on-one peer mentoring? Whatever it is, pursue it and work at
it with all your heart, serving the Lord and not man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly -- but really, this is the flip side of the first point -- make
sure to keep your own personal walk close to the heart of Christ. Quiet
times, Scripture, prayer, solitude, Bible study -- the normal spiritual
disciplines we all need to maintain. Keeping our character close to the
heart of Christ enables us to discern with wisdom and opens our eyes to
the opportunities and gentle nudgings that the Spirit provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly -- and this should flow quite naturally from the first two
points, because it's a part of Christian living -- build authentic,
constructive friendships with other believers who will encourage you to
grow closer to Christ and keep you accountable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of
doing, but let us encourage one another -- and all the more as you
see the Day approaching.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb10:25"&gt;(Hebrews
10:25)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to connect on a deep level with your brothers and
sisters in Christ; don't be afraid to initiate, even (and I do think
it's okay for both guys and girls to initiate!). But do it with an aim
to glorify Jesus and build up the other person in Christ -- not out of a
selfish desire to find a mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if, after getting to know someone, you find God laying that person
on your heart more and more deeply and frequently, then I'd say offer
that up to God, pray about it, and communicate honestly and openly with
the person. None of us knows what the future holds, but we know that God
holds all our futures. If we can approach each experience and each
relationship with integrity, purity, and selfless love, according
to God's truth and with an aim to glorify Him, then I believe we will be
able to look back on each experience and see God's hand at work, to know
this is something God has done, and give Him praise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What hath God wrought!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num23:23&amp;amp;version=9"&gt;(Numbers
23:23)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;blessings!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sean&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is two weekends in a row now that I'm at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chariscamp.com/"&gt;Charis
Camp!&lt;/a&gt; Last weekend was a family gospel camp,
but this time it's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ecbc.org/"&gt;ECBC's&lt;/a&gt; youth camp, specially
for teens! We've got over 120 kids, plus about 20 college-age
counsellors, and a handful of parent chaperon/counsellors, and me the
speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo is from the announcement time at the beginning of the Friday
night session. Any of the campers found to have violated any camp rules
are subject to a punishment randomly drawn from Garrett's Jar of Doom!
If I recall correctly, here the camper had to lie down on the ground
while another camper, standing on a chair over him, took a big swig of
water and spewed it out all over him! Other Jar of Doom punishments
included the dreaded Wedgie, Purple Nurple, eating a whole spicy chili
pepper, and -- my personal favourite -- keeping both arms raised during
the whole 20min worship set! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just such a blast being with the kids; they are so precious! Many
of them will open right up to us, whether in one-on-one sessions, or
while playing games, or over lunch. Sometimes they'll even just snag us
walking between buildings: "hey, can I talk to you? I've got something
on my mind...." And indeed, the kids these days are dealing with a lot
in their lives -- broken homes, broken relationships, loneliness,
academic pressure, peer pressure, bad influences from friends,
insecurity, self-identity. Christ is the only solution, and the only one
who can fulfil what they're looking for -- the only true vine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our theme for the weekend is "Current" -- the kids came up with the
idea, using three meanings of the word for three topics: "Current" means
electrical current, reminding us that we need to be plugged into Christ
the source of life. "Current" also means an ocean current, reminding us
that just as one wave influences another, we can influence each others
as Christians and pass on the wave of Christ's life. Lastly, "current"
means the present time, now, reminding us that the world in the present
time is hostile to Christianity, and we need to shine God's light boldly
in a dark universe. Our key passage is John 15, which has three sections
talking about remaining in the vine, loving one another as Christ loved
us, and testifying about Christ to a world that will hate us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 15 is really a packed chapter, there's so much good stuff in there.
So at first, I tried to fit way too much material into the first talk;
it was perhaps aimed more at a college-level audience than to the teens,
and I also went overtime by about 20mins. Later, I was told that I
actually only have 30mins per talk! Yipes! So I tried to trim my
three-point outlines down to one point each... and still ran overtime!
:) But the kids did great; I could see the attentiveness in their eyes.
I had some funny and encouraging feedback from one counsellor who said
that her girls really enjoyed the talks; one girl said this was the
first retreat where she took so many notes -- her handbook was full of
blue! Heh, that's good, but even better is to see the fruit of God's
Spirit at work in their lives down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

church camps! Eight this summer, just about one every other week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend is the New Life gospel camp, a family camp with about 220
people, organized by Paul and Meiling and their bible study group. Since
it's positioned as a gospel camp, they didn't want to compete with
church camps, and intended for it to be aimed toward non-Christians who
are seeking. I had charge of the 20-odd teenagers, together with a team
of four or five other counsellors. The coworkers were from all over the
area, different churches, so some of us hadn't even met before the camp!
But we worked well together as a team; praise God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we ended up having a lot of joint activities between the teens
and the younger children; that was a lot of fun! But handling 53 kids
ages 3-16 in one enclosed room (with echo-y linoleum floors) was quite
an experience! Praise God that all of us coworkers really had a united
heart to bring the kids to the feet of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole weekend, I was running around scrambling at my usual frenetic
pace, so I didn't get to take any pictures with my camera. This frame
was shot by one of my boys Dustin, during our small group
discussion/hang-out time with the seven junior-high boys in my small
room. I think we spent more time tossing the ball around, blowing
bubbles, and repairing LED flashlights than we spent in deep sharing,
but it was time well-spent!&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't even leave the house! Time is so precious, I'm well aware of
it, but still I squander so much of it on things of no consequence.
Frustrated at my own sloth, I kicked myself out of the house -- maybe a
walk and some fresh air will do me good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langley is a booming suburb, and my townhome is in a strategic location
to witness its transformation. I'm right on the border between the
semi-urban commercial core of Langley City and the quiet, suburban
Langley Township. Today, I opted to walk up the hill behind my house,
Jericho Ridge, deeper into the suburbs. The further up I walk, the nicer
the houses get, segueing from attached multi-dwelling units to
single-family homes -- still quite tightly packed, though, with
postage-stamp backyards and a "spacious eight feet between each home".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this cool, bright summer evening, the lanes are quiet, adorned with
the occasional peals of children's laughter and the spray of young men
washing sports cars. I pass by an elementary school yard, with kids
playing on the swings, and teens tossing frisbees. Row after row of
identical homes, high wooden fences neatly dividing the backyards. Where
one home has added a hardwood deck, the others follow suit. This one has
a large beige patio umbrella; the next-door neighbour topped them with
an even larger green one. As the evening sky deepens I can see into some
of the kitchens, gleaming with stainless steel and artistic halogen
accent lights. Young couples putting on elegant dinner parties, sipping
glasses of wine and watching enormous flat-screen TVs. In one house, the
18-foot living room walls are neatly decorated with contemporary
styling, large custom-shaped mirrors with sharp angles. The couch and
coffee table are impeccable, as is the backyard. I mutter under my
breath, "no kids". :) Another single family home, roughly in the
$400-450k range, advertises with lawn signs, "Happy 30th birthday!" --
the owner is my age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking to myself, what is the cost of suburbia? The great North
American dream? Would I live that? At what cost? I pass two private
schools, one a daycare, one an elementary school, in addition to the
public elementary school. Both were recently constructed in the last two
years, modern buildings with the latest in facilities and amenities.
Could I afford to send my kids there? If I do end up in full-time
ministry, or indeed even if I continue on at my current position, I'm
not so sure I'd ever be able to afford the Great Suburban Dream,
especially here in the Lower Mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it's easy to preach against materialism, to scoff against the
rat-race and the trap of "bigger boys getting bigger toys". But is it
wrong for a father to want to give the very best to his kids? A good
education, a safe neighbourhood, a backyard for them to run and play in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a year ago when our church gave a farewell party for our
children's pastor of eighteen years, a faithful and under-appreciated
servant to a whole generation of church kids. As a going-away gift, the
church gave his family a brand new oven/stovetop -- a nice gesture, to
be sure. But what sticks in my memory most was the look on the faces of
the pastor and his wife, how deeply they were moved, because of how much
they had needed a new stove. Yes, it was a nice gift, but really, it
cost only, what, six or seven hundred dollars? Rather than giving it to
them as a one-time gift, we as a church really should have made sure his
salary was enough so that they could afford to buy it when they needed
it. Near as I can tell, our church is flush with cash; do we still have
the preconception that the servant of the Lord must be poor in the eyes
of the world? That being wealthy is unholy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I belong here in the suburbs? Could I afford to raise a family here?
Could I afford it if I go into full-time ministry? Now, I'm fairly
certain that God does have in store for me the wonderful gift and
responsibility of raising a family, someday, but this moment does
challenge me with the question: &lt;em&gt;Am I willing to sacrifice even my dream
of raising a family, to put it on the altar, for the work of Christ and
the kingdom of God?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, in prayer meeting, an auntie comforted me with the story
of a missionary who spent fifty years of her life unmarried, fully
dedicated to God's work. That was her calling, and that was where God
placed her. But in her fifties, she met a wonderful Christian man, hit
it off right away, and they got married. The auntie was telling me this
story to reassure me: "see, even she got married, all in God's time!".
Yeah, thanks -- but I sure hope I don't have to wait until my fifties!
:) Still, if God were to call me to that kind of life, would I be
willing to give up having a family? Ach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking through these upper-middle-class neighbourhoods, I'm surrounded
and tantalized by the sight of what I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have, what is quite within
my grasp -- I have more than enough credentials, more than enough
education, talent, and capability to earn houses and backyards and
schools and idyllic suburban life. Can't I do both? Can't I live the
suburban dream without selling out? &lt;em&gt;"You cannot serve God and Mammon."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lift up my head and suddenly I notice, nestled on the hillside amongst
the $400,000 houses, this building pictured here. It's the local Kingdom
Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses. They are quite active, going door-to-door
with strategic maps of the neighbourhood, always in twos. They are in a
prime location amidst all these suburban residences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I'm reminded: there's a war on. It's an unseen, spiritual war
over the hearts and minds of all these people, over the guys washing
their cars and the couples giving dinner parties, over the kids playing
in their backyards and every single soul who passes me on the street.
Oh, forgive me, Lord, for I have been asl﻿eep in the Light, laying back
on my couch instead of launching forward into the fight! I pause and
kneel on the corner of their property, to pray in the Spirit against the
forces of darkness and the powers of Satan that would deceive so many.
But I feel so behind in the fight, so disabled and ineffectual; I have
squandered so much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often use the term "weekend warriors" to describe avid amateurs:
although they don't do it professionally, they invest many hours and
much energy in their hobby, recreation, or charity during their spare
time. There are weekend warriors in photography, dance, badminton,
soccer, politics. Many of us, myself included, are weekend warriors at
church. I'd never thought of being a "weekend warrior" as a bad thing.
After all, we all have to work through the week to pay the bills, so the
weekends are "me time" -- we're all volunteers, we don't have to be
here. The church -- the pastor -- should be grateful that we're even at
church, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I realize that the spiritual war continues with or without me, I
recognize being a spiritual weekend warrior is not a good thing! Satan
doesn't take Mondays to Fridays off; he's working 24/7 to destroy the
work of God. In the spiritual battle, I can't just ask the opposing side
for a cease-fire because I need to pick up the dry-cleaning or shuttle
the kids to soccer practise or finish a big project at work. I need to
be ready, girded for battle, praying in the Spirit at all times and on
all occasions. A soldier who is a warrior only on the weekends will be
attacked and injured on the weekdays -- and that's exactly what happens
to my spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and
His kingdom:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove,
rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;search=2Tim4:1-2"&gt;(II Timothy 4:1-2,

&lt;p&gt;Last month our Friday night fellowship &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2008/dinner-in-lieu-of-starfield-concert"&gt;had planned to
attend&lt;/a&gt; the Christian
music band Starfield's concert at Willingdon Church, but it got
postponed due to an accident the night before. Finally, tonight
Starfield came back for the make-up concert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concert was great -- and all the better once I rolled up bits of
tissue paper to use as makeshift ear-plugs! :) I'm serious, I really
enjoy these concerts a lot more when my ears don't hurt.... The kids
still squeezed in tight up front at the foot of the stage, but the band
was very clear, "NO JUMPING".... :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hilarious, when the lead singer came out at the start of the
evening, he was clearly quite surprised at how much of the audience was
Asian -- probably over 60%! Yay for Chinese Christians! With all the
churches that I have opportunity to serve in, I knew a gazillion people
there, and nearly spent more time catching up with old friends before
and after the concert than I spent actually listening to the concert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin was also there, but up front serving as a bouncer/security for the
stage -- he looked ubercool in his black short-sleeve T-shirt, showing
off his biceps! And here in this photo are our girls, Sunny, Steph,
Ingrid, and Claire!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's summertime, finally! And that means BBQ time! Our TGIF
young-adults' group at Surrey Christian Alliance Church had a wonderful
time of fellowship today on the shores of Buntzen Lake, north of
Coquitlam. The weather has been typically Vancouver-rainy for so long,
we were really praying for clear skies for the BBQ! And God answered! It
was beautifully blue, without a cloud in sight, the whole time we were
eating. Then later, when we went for a leisurely four-hour hike along
the Buntzen Lake Trail, it was lightly overcast -- just enough to keep
us cool, perfect temperature! It didn't rain until that evening, while
we were inside eating dinner. Just right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Steph for organizing and buying the bulk of the food and
equipment, including that cool little portable grille for only $15! It
was such a precious time together, with old friends and new friends,
enjoying God's creation and the fellowship in the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

to go back to work, so we moved back to my sister's place south of
Boston. There are still three family units and four kids under one roof,
so it's still exciting and different, but somehow, being at home has a
different feel from staying at the hotel resort -- a little less like
vacation. We spent more time checking our emails and doing routine
things around the house; we didn't have a "grand adventure" to go on
today. But, I think after all the excitement over the weekend, we'd had
enough grand adventures, and everyone, both big and small, needed a bit
of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Yes, so every time we get together as a family, our mom really wants&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;us to have a nice family portrait -- so she can show us off everywhere
she goes, of course! One family reunion back before any of the kids
were born, we had a family portrait that included my sister-in-law
before they got married -- I think it was even before they were
engaged.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;That family photo got circulated through the many churches my parents&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;speak at, and even got published in one of their books. Fortunately,
my brother did marry her -- it would have been mighty awkward if they
hadn't gotten married and she was still in those books!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo is just in our hotel room, with all the kids piled on the
bed, and the adults around them. We're kind of grouped by families,
except that Jake is in the wrong spot. Ah well, it's a lot better than
can be hoped for! We were able to take three bursts of shots before the
overlapping windows of happiness for all the little ones started
closing....&lt;/p&gt;

For my birthday this year I treated myself to one of my favourite
operas, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_bohème"&gt;"La Bohème"!&lt;/a&gt; I
booked the tickets several months in advance, but even then within my
price bracket I could only get seats way up in the nose-bleed section,
joy! Should have brought binoculars....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a packed house; a bit stuffy up in the balcony. I still maintain
that in the Queen Elizabeth Theatre there are no bad sightlines -- every
seat has an excellent view -- but the acoustics deteriorate a bit way up
in the cheap seats. I couldn't hear the soloists all that well
(completely unamplified), and the rustling papers and shuffling feet of
other patrons echoed off the ceiling. Next time, I'll try for the lower
seats in the balcony, just behind the dress circle, like I had for &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/the-nutcracker"&gt;the
Nutcracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, once the orchestra got going with Puccini's sensuous, lush
swells, it didn't really matter much; I lost myself in the music, so
much so that the poor girl behind me had to tap me on the shoulder to
get me to sit back in my seat! Ach, why does Puccini have to move so
quickly -- right in the first act he launches straight into the good
stuff, "Che gelida manina", Roldofo's song to Mimi, love at first sight.
Had me tearing up right away! Don't know why I'm becoming such a
hopeless romantic lately....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there's kind of a universal appeal to the story of "La Bohème"
-- no gods or heroes or mythical creatures here, just the story of four
everymen and their loves. But while gently poking fun at the youthful
naïveté of its protagonists, to me the music elevates their struggles
and hopes and loves to the transcendent -- universal emotions that any
audience can identify with, amplified and impassioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The opera went by way too quickly; I wish I hadn't spent so much time
reading the subtitles. There are so many scenes with multiple singers
and counterpoint; there's a lot to track -- throughout the whole
second act, the stage is full of players. I should have read up more
on the libretto before going, so that I wouldn't have to read the
subtitles -- which were atrocious, anyway! The little two-line display
had no hope of keeping up with the duets and quartets, and the
subtitles had to simplify so much, they made the dialogue even more
trite than it already is. "Che gelida manina" and "Sì, mi chiamano&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Mimì" -- Rodolfo's and Mimi's introductions to each other -- were so
trivialized in the subtitles that the whole thing felt more like a
19th-century episode of "Friends" than a timeless classic. I was
pretty miffed at that!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I just closed my eyes and forgot about tracking the subtitles,
the music was just sublime. Puccini was unashamed in bowing a whole
section of heart-strings, even as the glockenspiel lightly danced above,
and conductor Jacques Lacombe was masterful in guiding the dynamics.
Baritone Aaron St. Clair Nicholson was particularly notable in his
powerful rendition of Marcello, but soprano Frédérique Vézina (Mimi)
really needs to tone down that annoying vibrato -- her attempts at
holding a steady note only reveal that the vibrato is just trying to
hide lacking intonation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with tradition, I spotted a famous celebrity again at the
opera! Not a movie star this time, but the esteemed Dr. Paul Stevens
from Regent College, known for his marketplace ministry and marriage
counselling ministries! He would probably not like being called a
celebrity. :) He was there with his family, also in the cheap seats, a
few rows down from me. His left hand was all in a cast; hope it's not a
serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it was a pleasant evening, quiet and peaceful ... yeah, I'm
reasonably happy, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

big Starfield concert&lt;/a&gt; at Willingdon
Church today, but our plans got derailed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Starfield's concert the previous night in Abbotsford at Central
Heights MB Church, there was a terrible &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article682222.ece"&gt;incident wherein the
sanctuary floor
collapsed&lt;/a&gt;
under hundreds of kids! Thankfully, nobody perished; there were numerous
minor injuries but only two major injuries. God was certainly protecting
them! The insurance investigators and city engineers are continuing to
look at the building to see what exactly happened, but I blame it on
these kids nowadays and their "pogoing", jumping up and down in time to
the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;begin crotchety old man voice&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;These young-'uns and their newfangled jumping, why when I was their
age, we lifted our hands and were happy with that!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;end crotchety old man voice&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our concert tonight got cancelled, but still we wanted to get
together as a small group ... we can still pray for those who were
involved in the incident. We met at Anducci's in Guilford (thanks Sunny
for the great recommendation!) and had a nice meal, even though it was
only the three of us, followed by a pleasant walk out by Fort Langley.&lt;/p&gt;

the choir loft at Abbotsford Pentecostal, and somehow once again I'm
sitting in the front row, smack in the middle -- so I can't yawn, or
pick my nose, or anything! :) Up front is TWU president Dr. Jonathan
Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to space and time limitations, TWU's commencement is always split
into three ceremonies, divided by faculty. Our department of
Mathematical Sciences (including math, computing science, and physics)
doesn't usually see a lot of graduates -- this year, only a couple
computing science, and no math grads (we did have several math grads
last year). But I do get to teach the stats class for nursing, so I got
to see a number of my nursing students graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's always fun to cheer on students and send them off into the wide
world, wherever God takes them next! Still, today I was rather tired,
and glad just to be done with all the "pomp and circumstance"!&lt;/p&gt;

W &amp;lt;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.973583N123.084683W&amp;amp;t=h&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an odd feeling -- today feels like a real Sabbath! I know I've been
wearing myself thin lately, doing way too much; it's not sustainable
long-term. Teaching at TWU is enjoyable and provides some nice
stability, but the church ministries are where my heart's really at --
and the opportunities have really skyrocketed the past couple years. I
have, though, been trying to block out my Saturdays to be a Sabbath
rest: some time to think and pray and really wait upon the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://photo.seanho.com/2008-04_ACTS_Grad/"&gt;ACTS commencement
ceremony&lt;/a&gt; at South Delta
Baptist was really truly restful for me -- and not just because I didn't
have any responsibilities! (Next Saturday will be TWU's commencement;
that's when I'll have to wear my floofy hat and sit on stage.) The
atmosphere at the ACTS graduation was relaxed, steady, and worshipful. I
spread out across a couple pews in the sparsely-populated balcony and
enjoyed the soft worship music, while admiring the view out a wall of
40-foot-tall windows to a stand of Douglas Firs, and the amber fields
beyond. It was such a blessing to be there and cheer on friends; they
are both prepared and called to God's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church is pretty far away from home, but quite close to the border
with Point Roberts. I'd never been there, so after the ceremony, I
decided to swing south just to check things out. Point Roberts is a
peculiar little promontory on the Tsawwassen Peninsula, the tip of which
juts south of the 49th parallel, the boundary between Canada and the
U.S. There is no land connection from Point Roberts to the rest of
Washington State without going through Canada, although there are
ferries across Boundary Bay. The whole enclave is less than five square
miles in area, but it has a thriving industry of mailboxes and gas
stations for Canadian residents wishing to take advantage of good
exchange rates. There's even a NEXUS lane here (unlike at my nearest
crossing, in Lynden/Aldergrove), so my border crossing today was quick
and hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here on this rocky beach it's windy and chilly; the surf pounds and
smooths the stones at my feet. I stand on a large rock at the threshold
of the water, at the very tip of the peninsula, and face forward into
the wind, watching the clouds swirl past the sun. On the surface of the
waves, a small flock of loons bobs aimlessly, huddling together for
protection. Not far away, a small log of driftwood pokes up through the
surface of the water briefly, then disappears. Its motion seems a bit
more purposeful than mere driftwood, though. Suddenly, the loons
disperse and take to the sky, and in a moment I see the reason why: the
small log pokes up again; it is the snout of a sea lion, less than 30
feet away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time here today is a little less than my usual walks on the beach; I
need to get back. I still have many, many things I need to do; indeed,
many things past-due: marking and teaching, preaching and praying,
retreats and Sunday services, programs and people and relationships. But
today, this Sabbath day, my heart is kept in the peace of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and
petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will
guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/div&gt;

We're smack-dab in
the middle of finals, the stack of papers-left-to-mark is getting
taller, and my weekends are still wall-to-wall. I've realized that
during the summer I'll be preaching an average of 12 times a month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm rushing out the door just after teaching Sunday school at
CCGC and just before zipping off to lunch before Sunday school at S-ECBC
-- and then I stop, captivated by the brilliantly saturated colours of
this small tulip-and-bluebell garden behind the Edmonds Community

&lt;p&gt;My dear friends at Ark fellowship in Seattle, from my home church there,
ECC, graciously invited me down for the weekend to speak at their
retreat! Ark fellowship is a bilingual (sometimes tri-lingual) young
career / couples group renown for their close bonding and incredible
food! There are folks from all over -- Taiwan, China, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines -- but they find unity in Christ as
they travel through life together. Hence feeling like they're on Noah's
Ark! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retreat was held at cozy Camp Casey on beautiful Whidbey Island,
surrounded by water and greenery. The snow-capped Olympic Mountains lie
just across the water, and in the early morning, the sunrise lights them
aflame. In early April, it's still fairly cold and windy, but thankfully
it didn't really rain this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a wonderful time together; the size was just perfect, so that we
all could fit into two cabins, and even during the free time, most of us
stuck together in one big group. The food was just amazing, better than
I usually eat at home! We had a full layout of rice porridge for
breakfasts, two- and three-course meals, and the last evening we even
had hotpot, with four butane burners! That banner you see in the photo
is filled with messages of encouragement we all wrote to one another; we
had a "Secret Santa" kind of thing, called "小天使" -- Little Angel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our retreat theme was a "Dog in Sheep's Clothing" -- ah, it's a long
story.... Anyway, the challenge was to grow as a fellowship -- "stuck
together" (thinking, yoke, training, serving), and living the "CHIME"
(come close to God, hold fast the profession, impact one another, meet
together, encourage). On the last night, we even commemorated Holy
Communion together -- that was special; it was the first time I've led
communion for others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retreat came to a close too quickly, but the relationships built up
in Christ will last forever! 'Til next time!&lt;/p&gt;

packed Sunday -- and all my Sundays are packed nowadays! We're here at
White Rock beach with the tide mostly out, although the sand is still
wet in most places. I realized later that there's a lesson to be gained,
even from just a low-key Sunday-afternoon stroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traipsing along the muddy flats in our Sunday best, initially we had to
choose our pathway very carefully. My "Sunday best" shoes are the same
shoes I wear everywhere -- one pair of Birkenstocks for all occasions!
Still, rivulets of water would in places isolate the solid ground into
islands -- if we didn't plan our route carefully, we'd end up blocked in
by water, and have to backtrack to find a spot to "ford" the little
streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we gave up and took off our shoes and socks, rolling up our
pant-legs to wade into the water. Oh, the freedom in that first,
decisive step into the mud! There was no going back once our feet were
wet. But with that barrier passed, we were fearless in walking freely
anywhere on the beach -- if anything, it was more comfortable to be in
the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit dangerous, though -- once you go forward, it's a lot harder
to go backward. Walking back to the sidewalk, we had to cross a stretch
of hard pebbles and poky broken shells; that was painful! Life is full
of lessons....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Easter weekend, our small group took a pleasant little outing to
walk the forest trails around Buntzen Lake reservoir, north of Port
Moody. The weather forecast was for rain, and although parts of the
trail were a bit moist, thankfully it didn't rain at all the whole time
we were there! We went as far as we could, about halfway around the
lake, until the trail was completely flooded. A little nice exercise and
some good conversations with friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot survive without Sabbaths. It's a claim in the Bible, it's an
observed fact, and it's the cry of my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year as a whole, I've been perpetually barely nose-above-water, and
once midterms hit, the all-nighters to finish marking homeworks and
exams really took a toll. Last night SCAC had a wonderful "FAT" (Family
Activity Time) at the gym, and we had a lot of fun playing badminton,
but there were times I was so tired I got a bit dizzy; just couldn't
think straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today I did get a real Sabbath, a chance to rest in Jesus, to let
the wind carry away all the voices and to-do lists, controversies and
politics, and wait upon the Lord. I got a good night's sleep, had a good
lunch, and drove out here to the waterfront and beach at White Rock. In
the summertime it's quite a tourist spot, and even in the chill wind and
patchy clouds of this brisk March day, there are still quite a lot of
people out on the waterfront walkway. I venture out onto the wide flats
at low tide, where there are fewer people and the sand is soft beneath
my sandals. The sand is moist and dotted with patches of bright green
sea grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other lonesome beach excursions I'll have chats, even debates, with
God, praying my heart out and listening for His reply. But not today. Of
late my head has just been too full of words -- too many things to think
about, hats to wear, people to shepherd, irons in the fire. I have
half-a-dozen summer retreats to be preparing for in parallel, sermons,
Sunday schools, discipleship, planning. How should I allocate my time;
who should I invest time in to get to know better; who do I have to let
go of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on this beach, I speak no words to God, and I hear no words from
Him, and it is okay. Sometimes words don't need to be said. In His
presence, my heart is quieted by His love -- to trust in Him, to be
still and know that He is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The LORD your God is with you, he is mighty to save.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;He will take great delight in you,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;he will quiet you with his love,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;he will rejoice over you with singing.&lt;/div&gt;

the missions conference of my old home
church, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eccseattle.org/"&gt;ECC&lt;/a&gt;. Even just in the couple days
I've been down here so far, such a flood of emotions has swept me up; I
haven't had a chance to catch my breath until today. Coupled with
chronic lack of sleep this school year, it was a bit overwhelming (but
joyous!) for me. Thankfully, this week is our spring reading break, so
today I got a chance to sleep in and let my body recover. The photo
above is from Dennis' lovely nature-filled backyard, surrounded by
Douglas firs and cedars, set to the tune of chirping birds, awash in the
warm light of the setting sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECC is the church I was born and grew up in; I have a lot of good
memories here, and still have a lot of aunties and uncles, brothers and
sisters in Christ here -- real family! Just to see the faces of those
old friends, and to know that they're still faithfully serving the Lord,
is so incredibly powerful and moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I'm also aware of the myriad problems within the church -- so
very similar to the problems at the large Chinese churches I'm involved
with back in Vancouver. So much structure, but so little communication.
So many full-service programs, but so many people running on empty.
Living in the lap of luxury, yet still needy, demanding, complaining.
The "silent exodus" of second-generation Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several here have made no secret about wanting me to come back, say as a
youth pastor at EKC -- my Uncle Peter is already there leading things.
It would be such an honour to be working alongside the likes of Willy
and Nate, who were &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; youth counselors when I was high-school age!
But, as the saying goes, you don't just marry one person, you marry into
a whole family. And if I were to be on staff anywhere in the ECC system
... oh boy, that would, shall we say, require a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of prayer....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I care deeply about my home church here. I remember her in prayer, and
though I feel quite helpless, I know she is Christ's bride, and He is
the one who will clean her up. It was such an immense privilege to stand
before my own extended church family and share the word of God last
Sunday at the EKC campus. The English congregation has grown
tremendously! I'm a little nervous now about next Sunday, when I'll be
preaching in English service at the Seattle campus -- I'll be addressing
many of my uncles and aunties, many of whom changed my diapers when I
was small! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECC-EKC is very efficient about getting &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eccseattle.org/ekc/sermons-english/"&gt;their sermons posted
online&lt;/a&gt;; here
is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanho.com/church/EKC-080224-Freedom.wmv"&gt;the audio recording of my sermon from Isaiah 61:1-4, titled,
"FREEDOM!" (12MB 52min
wmv)&lt;/a&gt;. It starts
from Elton's congregational prayer, then runs through my (slightly
over-time) message, wrapping up with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://songs.seanho.com/god_of_justice.html"&gt;response
song&lt;/a&gt; that Kelvin
graciously let me lead for the congregation. I always get a bit scared
and embarrassed to listen to a recording of myself! (Is my voice really
that squeaky?) :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; The following week I got to speak at the main Seattle campus
of ECC -- it's the very sanctuary and congregation I grew up in, and it
was pretty emotional for me. Here's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://seanho.com/church/ECC-080302-Missions_and_the_Sabbath.wmv"&gt;my sermon from Isaiah 58,
"Missions and the Sabbath" (9MB 38min
wmv)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

to the wire, prepping at the very last minute, whether lectures or
marking or Bible pre-study or sermon prep -- I feel pretty shaky! I did
not take a proper Sabbath yesterday (Saturday) like I should have, and
I'm feeling the effects today. This morning's service at SVPG went well,
but I was low on energy, and although the Scriptures still have all the
power and efficacy, I think I could have conveyed that power more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some time between 11:20 and 3pm, when Coquitlam ECBC English
service starts, so I briefly considered swinging by FL, which I haven't
visited in nearly a year. But then, I imagined, we'd stay chatting until
1pm, go out for lunch, and I'd be rushing to CECBC -- the same go-go-go
schedule I usually have on Sundays. This is okay sometimes, but not a
good thing when I haven't had a Sabbath yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, I took a quiet lunch here on this park bench at the small
Como Lake in Coquitlam. It is still quite chilly; there are patches of
snow still on the ground in shaded areas, and the lake has a very thin
layer of ice on top. It was so pleasant just to be still, to pause for a
moment: the &lt;em&gt;"shabbat"&lt;/em&gt;-- simply to &lt;em&gt;cease&lt;/em&gt;. I didn't have quite as
much time for prayer as I wanted to, but I did nearly finish memorizing
the book of Philippians, a month-long project with one of my small
groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched a pair of ducks try to work their way toward each other
through the ice -- if it were a bit warmer, the ice would be gone and
they could just paddle through the water. If it were a bit colder, the
ice would be thicker, and they could walk on it. But the ice is just
thin enough that the moment they put weight on it, it collapses, making
for slow going. It was so cute to see the mallard duck trying so hard to
get to his mate. Then once they finally reached each other, there was
this awkward moment, like, "okay, we're here; now what?". :) So they
just dipped their bills in and out of the water and chatted quietly.
Awww!&lt;/p&gt;

Or so it was in my dream last night, at
any rate. :) I've been having some weird dreams lately, mostly little
vignettes that I can't remember well; I think it's because I've been so
busy and had so much on my mind that I don't rest very well and pop in
and out of REM sleep. No, I don't really believe that God has literally
spoken to me through dreams (not that He couldn't, but He has more
effective ways), but sometimes I do think my dreams reflect what I've
been subconsciously thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up around 5am from a really clear dream, so I
immediately typed up as much as I could remember of it, before it all
faded away. I used to do this sometimes on paper journals; typing on the
laptop is much faster. I post it here in unedited honesty -- I think it
does indicate some things I'm wrestling with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(oh, and the photo above is from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://photo.seanho.com/2006-04_Seattle_EKC_FUN/1d-26911"&gt;a trip to Seattle a couple years
ago&lt;/a&gt;; I
thought it might be a good illustration to accompany the dream.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth has been taken over by aliens! They can take form to look and
talk like people, and we are not totally sure if they're friendly or
not; it's kind of like a benevolent dictatorship. Their technology
is unfathomably beyond ours; there's no contest and no resistance. I
and others I know are being rounded up; we're in a bus or something
similar, in a major metropolitan area (Seattle?). It's cold but
sunny outside as we pass the waterfront and see the sparkling modern
buildings, reshaped and transformed somehow by alien technology....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we pass a huge ice rink, two colours are playing; one is the
Calgary Flames. Somebody on the bus comments, "Flames suck!" :) ....
The general feeling is that the aliens don't want us to be unduly
alarmed; life can still go on -- but they are definitely in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're rounded up into a giant stadium, packed with maybe 20,000
people, maybe 200,000; I don't know. Human-form aliens are scattered
amongst us, almost 1:1; they can talk with us and are generally
friendly but a bit quiet. I still have this overriding anxiety about
what's going on -- what do they want, what will happen to us -- but
the aliens are efficient and in control: they have a plan, and they
know what they're doing.... If they had wanted to kill us, they
could easily have done so already, so maybe they really are
friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alien sitting next to me is a girl; I'm with others I know and
they seem to accept her readily. She's pretty and soft-spoken and
doesn't seem to have much of a personal agenda when she talks with
us -- if they have a nefarious hidden-agenda, she doesn't know it,
and she's just following what is the accepted track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm now wearing some sort of big, loose jacket, with a separable
lining; it doesn't fit well and might be upside-down. There are a
couple rows of snap-buttons to button it up, but the buttons
protrude about 2in instead of the usual half-a-cm -- shaped like a
metal cylindrical dowel, about a cm in diameter. Female end of the
button is about the same as normal. There's some kind of magnetic
locking, so that the tip of the dowel snaps in. &lt;em&gt;[ definitely
inspired by my trenchcoat's buttons in real life ]&lt;/em&gt; The
buttons/dowels don't line up with the female ends in number or
position. It was designed by the aliens for us. I'm waiting a bit to
see what will happen; some announcements are being made but I'm not
listening closely; they seem to be just general pleasantries. I'm
snapping and unsnapping the buttons/dowels on my jacket. &lt;em&gt;[ as I
do in real life when I fidget! ]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alien girl, though quiet, seems to have chosen or connected with
me, and she seems reasonable enough. She's my new companion
escorting me into this new world. I'm with other (humans) I know,
but only a few of us amongst this huge crowd, and I'm not sure
what's happened to everyone else I know. So although I'd be sad to
leave them if I had to, if this girl will be the one to help me
adjust to the new order, then I'd better get to know her. She tells
me to snap one of the top button/dowels into a particular snap on my
jacket. I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd is starting to get up; the orientation ceremony is over
and we're moving on to the next phase (whatever that is).
Official-looking aliens are coming through the crowd rounding up
people and aliens. (Note that all the aliens look and act completely
human and speak intelligibly to us.) The alien girl next to me gets
a bit nervous. I get the feeling that having me put the dowel in a
particular snap means something important and will cost her
something: she is making some kind of commitment to me. I think it
also means I have made some kind of commitment to her, but I'm not
sure what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alien official comes around to me and notices my dowel on my
jacket. He asks both me and her, "You understand what this means,
right? You're sure about this?". Yipes, no, I don't know what it
means! But she's nice, and if as I suspect the alternative is to be
killed or put in a concentration camp or cast out of society, I'd be
okay with being with her.... I look at her anxiously, but she
reassures me, "it just means you'll be brought into our society".
Okay, I still don't know what that means; their society could mean
almost anything -- I picture in my mind being plugged into some
Matrix-style pods, my body used for energy harvesting, or being her
house-servant for life, or something ... of course, I wouldn't mind
living as her servant in this clean and technologically-advanced
society, and again she seems nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official is getting impatient; he expects an answer. The dowel
is in the snap. My girl is looking expectantly but nervously at me.
I realize that this is costing her as much as it will cost me. OK,
I'll go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's when I woke up! :) Well, I'll leave it to you to make your
own Freudian interpretation -- who are the aliens in my life!&lt;/p&gt;

W &amp;lt;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.164736N122.60416W&amp;amp;t=h&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequent, light snowfall we've been getting in recent weeks has
dusted the nearby Golden Ears with a beautifully soft powder, in this
photo taken last week. I had driven by this location in Fort Langley
before, where the view of the Golden Ears is bold and unobstructed over
open farmland. So when the skies cleared and I knew we were in for a
terrific sunset, I grabbed the big 300/2.8 lens and a sandwich, headed
to this spot, setup the tripod and composition, then relaxed in the car
and waited about 20 minutes for the light to get good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exposure, the sun is still hidden behind a scrim of altocirrus,
so the lighting on the mountains is very even, almost shadowless. I also
have a series of exposures taken a bit later, when the sun peeks out
from beneath the clouds, right before sunset. A narrow, diffuse band of
fuchsia-purple works its way from the foothills up the mountain, before
the sun completely disappears beneath the horizon. But I still like this
frame best: I think the pastel monochrome accentuates the textures in
the forests and in the rocky peaks. It's exposed a bit dark because
it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; dark, and cold, and peaceful in the twilight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past six months or so, I think I've been settling into a style of
ministry that fits, and which matches what I had envisioned before I
moved to Canada three years ago. It's a bit unconventional, and I don't
claim that anyone else should follow in my footsteps, but it's really
freeing -- it's a bit like living by faith. It's carrying out &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/missionsfest-musings"&gt;the
call I wrote about a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. I simply
go where I'm invited to speak or teach, in submission to God's call.
It's a ministry which is simultaneously corporate and personal,
community and individual, working within the churches but also deepening
my own spiritual walk with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the churches feel safer with me because they know I have no
intention of starting my own church -- that constant fear of "sheep
stealing". (I just heard of yet another Chinese church English pastor
who left to start his own church! I'm of two minds about this trend.) I
think there is a lot that could happen if our existing churches were to
wake up and be revitalized by the transforming power of the Holy Spirit,
and I simply want to be an encouragement to them through the Word of
God. Mine is a ministry in community, because the whole point is to
build up the local churches, to assist and encourage the local pastors
and leaders, and ultimately, to break down un-Biblical dividing walls
between churches. If I serve and contribute to various different
churches, I can be an ambassador from each one to the others, bringing
greetings and sending blessings. As I have often said, the various
churches in Christ are not competitors, but collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, because I am focusing my work on the
preaching/teaching ministry of the Word of God, it's a personal journey.
Moving from church to church, I confess that I sometimes forget names
and past prayer requests -- I wish my memory were better; I wish I could
have super-deep relationships with each one, but I am limited. I do
treasure each relationship, and I'm so grateful for all my loving
brothers and sisters in all the churches. As far as authenticity and
transparency are concerned, I have no problem sharing my fears and
struggles, in person or from the pulpit. I have nothing to hide -- as
dear readers of my blog know well! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am
under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;&amp;amp;search=1Cor9:16"&gt;(I Corinthians
9:16)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; preach the Word of God; I am constrained to. I think our
generation has despised preaching -- we don't want to listen, and we
don't want to preach. I think we've already seen the results of this
manifested in a lack of Biblical mentality. In nearly every church I've
been, less than ten percent of the congregation has regular personal
devotions, and even fewer have read the whole Bible even once! Pastors
habitually abdicate their preaching responsibility because it's too
hard, then wonder why the church isn't unified in its teaching! No
wonder our young people are floundering in lack of discernment, and the
older generation is largely impotent to teach them -- without the
authority of Scripture, they can only fall back on, "well, we've always
done it this way!". This was the fall of the U.S. "Bible belt" over the
past 50 years, and it's reached our Chinese churches now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it feels as though the only constant I have from week to week
is the presence of Jesus and the unchanging truth of His Word. I have so
much deeper to go into the Scriptures -- I want to learn Hebrew and
Greek well; I want to be doing my quiet times in the original languages;
I want to be memorizing whole books. I also want to be challenged
regularly to communicate that truth to the believers and to the unsaved,
in a way which is both faithful to the text and engaging and practical.
This is my personal journey, which may take a lifetime to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's sometimes a lonely journey. We talk a lot about mentorship, but I'm
not convinced discipleship is as simple as a small-groups sign-up sheet.
Discipleship is not just meeting in a coffee-shop once a month;
it's &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;serving&lt;/em&gt; together. Those who would truly follow
me would need to be willing to travel with me, and that's not easy. I
don't think there are many people who have a similar ministry calling. I
am cheered as I go from one body of believers to another, but my own
journey may be one I have to walk alone for some time yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes ... I think that if I find even one person to walk this path
alongside me, that will be plenty.﻿&lt;/p&gt;

white winter wonderland now! The past week or two, temperatures have
hovered right at or below freezing, with a lot of moisture -- so either
we get a bunch of snow, or a bunch of rain, or something in-between!
Last night was foggy and freezing -- perfect conditions for black ice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minute ago, snow was falling quite thickly, although it's tapering off
now. It's so peaceful outside, as the snow traps echoes and stills the
landscape. And here in its midst, I feel my Heavenly Father trap and
still my own heart. The snow-laden boughs are so pretty on this quiet
stand of trees just outside my building on TWU campus; it's just a few
steps from my office. It would be lovely just to sit in silence and
watch as woods fill up with snow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I last had a free Sunday afternoon to go
exploring. I used to have time after church to go driving,
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/ferry-at-horseshoe-bay"&gt;Horseshoe Bay&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/north-lonsdale"&gt;up the
hills of North Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, or all the
way &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/mt-shuksan-from-picture-lake"&gt;out to Mount Baker&lt;/a&gt;, or
even just close by at &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/trout-lake-after-church"&gt;Trout Lake&lt;/a&gt;.
But the past several months, Sundays have just been zounds-busy for me,
and the afternoons are usually occupied with teaching Sunday School, or
small group, or somesuch. It is nice to take a relaxing walk today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a chill wind today blowing up from below the dam, but at this
spot on a grassy hill next to the reservoir, the air is quiet. Above,
the skyscape changes quickly as the clouds are whisked along by the
arctic front. Patterns of light and shadow skip across the forested
hills; the mountains are tipped with brilliant white snow-covered pines.
I take a deep breath; a lot still weighs on my mind, but I am captivated
by this beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I had a splendid time at Vancouver Chinese Mennonite Church
and Chinese Grace Mennonite Churches, sister churches both shepherded by
Pastor Billy. It warmed my heart to see the cozy family atmosphere at
these small churches -- the English services were only about 20-30 each.
But there was a joy on the kids' faces in being there, and a contentment
in the parents. Poor Pastor Billy has his hands quite full, though,
running between the two -- and now Basel Hakka wants him to help out
there, too, now that Pastor Karli has stepped down to be a full-time
mom. We'll keep praying for them!&lt;/p&gt;

They
are both so sweet and gentle, with such fervent hearts to serve the

on worshipping God and giving Him all the glory. I thought it was
very &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt;, without any taint of the awkward weird partying that
often accompanies non-Christian weddings. It reflects a simple
child-like faith and a heritage of following the Lord. I found
particularly touching the slideshow presentation at the reception

simple and straightforward, with relatively little angst -- truly a

&lt;p&gt;Well, I've heard so much about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cccwc.ca/"&gt;Canada Chinese Christian Winter
Conference&lt;/a&gt;, and this year I finally got the chance
to go, as a workshop speaker for the teens. This year (and last year,
and next year) it was at the Hyatt in beautiful Calgary, where it's
sunny and ten-below-zero (Celsius). Here's a view of the neighbouring
Calgary Tower, seen from the 18th-floor indoor pool. I hardly left the
hotel, though -- I was there for the kids, so everything I wanted to see
was inside the building!&lt;/p&gt;

people, sometimes much smaller. I had heard that in the past it had had
financial issues, political in-fighting, a penchant to drain and
burn-out coworkers, and a reputation for being a bit of a meet-market
amongst the teens and young adults. But I had also heard that it had
changed so many lives, connected and united fellow Christians, and
dozens had started their path to full-time ministry at WinterCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did it meet my expectations? Yes, and then some -- in both good and bad
ways! I had strategically declined any sort of administrative
responsibilities, so I was distanced from the politics, but in chatting
with the coworkers, I could hear the stress imposed by competing
expectations. The teens' side went pretty much as I expected -- fun and
passionate and full of crises and breakthroughs, just as life is for
teenagers! Youth retreats are still rewarding every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The English adults' side was curious for me to see, quite slick and "HK
cool", I thought. The worship times felt a lot like TWU praise chapel,
which I suppose shouldn't be surprising since most of the crowd was
college/university age. I was pretty disappointed with the messages: the
speaker was a seminary prof who had lovely lyrical poetry, but very
little to say of practical depth. I would often pop in for the worship
but head over to the youth side for the messages and altar-call
follow-up. If I had to sum it up in a word: "comfortable".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With teens, the crises are so often visible right on the surface -- they
wear their hearts on their sleeves. When a four-year-old is bored, she
will let you know (very loudly, if necessary!). When a fourteen-year-old
is mad at God, he will let you know -- destructively, if necessary. As a
result, I've found that particularly in youth ministry, one tends to
feel perpetually on the verge of catastrophe. But it is this urgency
that propels us forward, drives us down to our knees, and keeps us
ever-vigilant, never-stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a dream recently that I was back in resident youth ministry -- as
an incumbent youth worker, a lay youth pastor, for a group of 30-40 kids
at some small Chinese church. We had a special all-church event, and the
children were presenting a song, and the teens were supposed to present
something, as well. We were practising in a different room and needed to
get over to the main sanctuary, so I sent the kids over ahead of me
single-file -- but then I needed to run ahead of them, to make sure the
adults were ready for us, make sure the kids didn't sit in the very
back, make sure there were enough chairs for them, etc. The overriding
feeling I had in my dream was that I needed to run as fast as I possibly
could -- and even that wasn't fast enough. I get that feeling a lot in
youth work! :) But it isn't a demoralizing, guilt-inducing feeling;
rather, it's fun and exciting and keeps me constantly in prayer, leaning
on God's strength instead of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CCCWC theme this year was "Finishing the Race: Our Challenge and Our
Crown", and I just realized as I was typing this that it applies exactly
to my dream and that feeling of running as hard as I can: to provide for
the kids, to serve God, to pursue the goal. There is a restful peace
when I know I've put my whole effort in, and there is a revitalizing
energy in knowing that there is ever more that God is doing, far beyond
what I can ask or imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

the drive, so when we arrived at "Nai-nai"'s house (QQ's paternal
grandmother), the kids were a little antsy to get out and play. DD made
a bee-line for the stash of matchbox cars -- the very same cars that his
dad played with when he was small! QQ took a bit of entertainment by
finding her current location on this light-up globe, with the help of
her dad. Later on, we had lunch with Ivans' grandmother, aunts+uncles,
and cousins. I was joking around with my sister: my relationship to them
is that I'm their ... nephew's wife's brother ... which makes me ...
about as closely related to them as the waiter is. :) We still had a
good time, though!&lt;/p&gt;

have ever had the privilege to hear in-person. He+Sharon have been
pillars in the church in Seattle, ECC, serving faithfully for many
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend they led a marriage enrichment retreat out in Sumas, WA, so
after the retreat they swung up north of the border to come and visit
Eva and me! It was such a joy to see them and host them at my place,
even just for the night. My parents had often taken in Jun-Liang when he
was younger, so I considered it an honour to "continue the legacy" of
hospitality in a small way! They also are continuing the legacy of
mentorship, by mentoring a number of young-adults in the Mandarin
congregation at ECC -- including Eva when she was in Seattle. It was
good to see Eva again: even though we nominally attend the same church,
we rarely cross paths!&lt;/p&gt;

director at the church in NC, and although he may not be getting much
treasure here on earth for it, he is storing up an abundance of treasure
in heaven by discipling and investing in the lives of those teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've received a calling from God and a commissioning from Greater
Europe Mission (GEM) to pick up their family, move across the pond, and
be salt and light in a vastly under-served people group that has only a
nominal Catholic background. I am cheering them on; it's so exciting to
be following God's calling and living totally by faith in Christ!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight Tim hosted a special prayer meeting at their home to cover their
new mission with prayer. I joined in by speakerphone, a continent and
three time-zones away! (Thanks to Vonage and free long-distance!) I
snapped this photo so they'd have a face to attach to the voice, but I

custom, every three years she throws a big shin-dig with a gazillion
guests! Last night was part one of her birthday party: dinner and
dancing at a pretty swanky lounge in Richmond; we filled up nearly the
whole place. Dinner seemed fairly formal to me; a lot of people dressed
up, or at least came in their Sunday best. It was great fun chatting
with old friends from FL that I hadn't seen in a while, and meeting new
friends from Phebe's other circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be honest, the party also tired me out and gave me a bit of a
headache. I didn't circulate around the tables, opting instead to hide
out in a corner and talk more in-depth with a smaller number of people.
Even so, by about 11:30pm, the noise and the heat and my own tiredness
from a long Sunday caught up with me, and I had to call it a night, for
fear that I'd fall asleep on the drive home. Maybe it's just me: like
many guys, I think, I don't do well with big dinner parties. I did enjoy
it, but I think what I enjoyed even more was the short half-hour stroll
I took beforehand, along Richmond's waterfront dikes, in the dark and
the wind and the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found part two of Phebe's party much more rewarding! This afternoon,
four of us took a car-load of clothes and blankets donated by folks at
last night's party, sorted them into two very full shopping carts, one
for men's clothes and one for women's clothes, and walked through parts
of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside handing them out to anyone in need. To
be outside breathing the fresh chill air, looking people square in the
eye, touching them and ministering to their needs in some small way,
meeting strong and intelligent and dignified and down-to-earth men and
women who have such a keen sense of community -- now that's fun! :) I'd
done street evangelism and other urban volunteer work before, but this
was my first time in Vancouver's DTES. I learned so much about this
unique community; I wished I had had more time just to listen to the
residents! I think so many of our affluent suburban enclaves are so
lonely, so suspicious of outsiders and each other -- there's actually a
lot in the DTES that we should be envious of. Thanks, Phebe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Is this not the fast which I choose:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To loosen the bonds of wickedness,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To undo the bands of the yoke,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And to let the oppressed go free&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And break every yoke?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And bring the homeless poor into the house;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When you see the naked, to cover him;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And not to hide yourself from your own flesh?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Then your light will break out like the dawn,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And your recovery will speedily spring forth;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And your righteousness will go before you;&lt;/div&gt;

increasing beauty in things as simple as the late afternoon sun as it
falls on the side of a house. There is an essence there that I cannot
capture on film or CCD: it is, I think, the tranquil beauty of a heart
at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I last blogged; things have been very very busy
both at work and in church ministries -- and those two circles have
pretty much occupied the entirety of my time! But I've been trying hard
to preserve Saturdays as a Sabbath rest: when I cease striving, put my
to-do list on hold, and find my contentment in Christ alone. It's been
kinda fun to work a little harder during the week so that I can get my
errands done before Saturday. I look forward to it as a special date
with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God provided daily manna for the Israelites, He told them to gather
twice as much on the sixth day, so that they wouldn't have to go out on
the Sabbath. In the same way, I need to prepare my heart and consecrate
myself for the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, I'm not really ready for the Sabbath: my heart is tense; my mind
is racing with ideas and arguments and words unsaid; my hands clenched
and brow furrowed. But our Lord is so patient: as I come before Him and
acknowledge His presence, He softens my heart, stills my mind, and
renews my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I slept in quite late and still had to run a few errands,
swing south of the border to deposit checks, etc. But throughout the
day, through the shopping and driving and teeming crowds, God granted me
a measure of peace and contentment. At the Wal-Mart in Langley, I had a
chance to chat with an elderly gentleman selling poppy pins for veterans
-- his sister served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during WWII,
stationed in England, and barely survived a bomb blast that took out the
building next door. It was both sobering and encouraging to listen to
his story -- ordinarily, I talk way too much; it was so nice just to sit
and listen. Later, as I crossed the border, the line-ups were long with
Canadians going shopping, looking to take advantage of the exchange
rate. I got a nice kick out of using my new NEXUS card -- I got to
bypass the lines, the border agent was friendly, and the geek in me was
thrilled with the contactless RFID chip in the card! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a lot to learn about the Sabbath. I know I need to orient
it more toward selfless service and less on my own desires. But my heart
is well-prepared now for preaching and teaching Sunday school tomorrow:
I have rested in the Lord. Amid everything else that I'm still
frustrated or discontent with (much of which I've already blogged about
here!), I can honestly say that right now, on this Sabbath evening, in
the arms of my Saviour, I am truly content in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;If because of the Sabbath, you turn your foot&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;From doing your own pleasure on My holy day,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And call the Sabbath a delight, the holy day of the LORD
honourable,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And honour it, desisting from your own ways,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;From seeking your own pleasure and speaking your own word,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Then you will take delight in the LORD,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.&lt;/div&gt;

about halfway done and just really need a break. The scores so far are
looking pretty abysmal, and there are a number of students who it looks
like just completely gave up. Sometimes, students will have this
conception that we enjoy giving out hard exams and low marks just to
watch them suffer; it's really not the case. Marking is always a pain,
and marking poor exams is awful drudgery. When the students are so
clearly just not getting the concepts, completely misunderstanding the
fundamentals, it really hurts. I wonder if anything's going in, if I'm
making a difference at all. This semester I have been going a bit faster
than we usually do, but in the big picture this math course is the very
lowest-level math course we offer; it's material that really properly
belongs at the high school level -- and I think it used to be that way
in generations past. Yet, I still end up having to fail over a quarter
of the class each semester. It hurts. But I know it's tough love that
has to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is Thanksgiving here in Canada, and during these few hours I have
in between appointments, I find solace here in a little park behind
MetroTown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metropolis at MetroTown is a huge, sprawling, three-story shopping mall,
with two levels of underground parking and several attached restaurants
and other shops above ground. Within a block on either side, there are
also a couple other shopping malls like Station Square and Crystal Mall.
Especially on a holiday like today, it's a crowded, noisy mecca of
buying and selling, entertainment and excess, "consume and enjoy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just a few paces away from the retail core, at the foot of the
now-empty MetroTowers office buildings, nestles this tiny little park,
probably designed for office workers to enjoy their lunch breaks. A
small rectangular plot of grass lies in the middle, with an intriguing
mound at its centre -- is it some historical marker? An ancient First
Nations burial ground preserved amidst the rest of this new
construction? Or just a load of extra dirt? :) The maples surrounding
the rectangular grass plot are majestic in their peak fall colour --
deep red on the side opposite me; light amber on the side where I'm
sitting. Behind them, a slab of sleek steel and glass rises into the
brilliant blue sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever people at church ask me how I'm doing, I make every effort to
avoid giving a flippant reply, "Fine". OK, maybe sometimes they don't
really want to hear my whole life story starting from when I was a wee
tadpole, but I really want to be honest, so recently I've been saying,
with all honesty, "Angsty".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acquaintance of mine, Brian, recently shared about the point in his
life when things were getting really serious with his then girlfriend
(later wife). He got commitment-shy and ran for the hills -- more
specifically, he climbed a mountain in Africa. He tells of sitting on
top of the mountain, watching the sun rise over the foothills. It was so
beautiful -- and he had no one to share it with. He says it was like a
"sword in the heart". He climbed down the mountain and immediately
proposed to his wife (over the phone!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal devotions recently have been in the book of Exodus, and I
wonder what it must have been like to see God's pillar of cloud by day
and pillar of fire by night, leading Israel through the wilderness every
day for so many years. Even the manna God provided every morning was a
daily miracle -- but the Israelites soon took it for granted,
complaining about the lack of selection on the menu! As I reflect on my
life on this Thanksgiving day, I know that it is not that God has not
been showing me His will for my life, but that I have taken for granted
His constant hand of guidance. I read aloud the words of Psalm 77:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My heart mused and my spirit inquired:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;"Will the Lord reject forever?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Will he never show his favour again?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Has his unfailing love vanished forever?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Has his promise failed for all time?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Has God forgotten to be merciful?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Has he in anger withheld his compassion?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Selah&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps77:6-9"&gt;(Psalm
77:6-9)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;Selah&lt;/em&gt; indicates, we think, a pause for
contemplation, before a brief shout, and moving on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years of the right
hand of the Most High."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I will remember the deeds of the LORD;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;... You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
Aaron.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps77:10-11,20"&gt;(Psalm 77:10-11,
20)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pillar of fire has always been there, leading me, but I just treat
it like a night-light. I need to keep on trusting in Him every step of
the way -- He will open the right doors at the right time, and make the
next step such a natural, clear choice that it is evident to all that
God has done this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost time for my next appointment. I close my personal worship
time with God by singing aloud in this secluded, sunshine-filled
spot, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/h/l/hleademe.htm"&gt;this classic
hymn:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;He leadeth me, O blessed thought!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;O words with heav'nly comfort fraught!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Whate'er I do, where'er I be&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;He leadeth me, He leadeth me,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;By His own hand He leadeth me;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;His faithful follower I would be,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For by His hand He leadeth me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

mostly Mandarin-speaking, church in south Burnaby. There actually is
some age-old history between ECBC and my hometown church, ECC -- and
some of the politics is a bit sticky. Nevertheless, God has richly
blessed ECBC, and it's probably got the largest Taiwanese population
amongst churches in the Lower Mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECBC planted a small congregation in Surrey about ten years ago; this
branch runs about 100 people total -- adults, teens, children. It's got
a lovely small-church atmosphere, with lots of young families! They meet
Sunday afternoons here at Cedar Grove Baptist in Surrey; it's been a
tremendous blessing to have these spacious facilities. I've had a
relationship with this church for about a year now, speaking in their
Friday night teens' fellowship on science and the Bible, and again at
their church summer retreat. It's such a privilege and a joy to work
with the kids here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their request, now I get to teach the teens' baptismal class every
Sunday afternoon for the next three months, and although it does mean my
Sundays are rather full now, but it is so rewarding to be setting the
groundwork with these kids, establishing the basics of what it means to
be a Christian. The older I get, the more I see how easily even
well-meaning old-time Christians can wander astray, and the more I see
how important it is to lay a solid foundation at an early age!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an odd feature of my life that I have always commuted to church.
Usually, since there are not so many Chinese churches around, the
Chinese churches tend to be commuter churches rather than community
churches -- the members don't usually live right around the church.
There are certainly some pros and cons to this approach, but by now I'm
used to driving half an hour to church, sometimes four or five times a
week, for worship service, Bible study, prayer meeting, outreaches, etc.
Since my social circles so often grow out of the church community, I end
up spending most of my social engagements in that area, as well -- in
the current case, I'm spending a lot of time in town in Vancouver, even
though it's a 40-minute drive from home in Langley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this rainy Saturday afternoon, I have a couple hours in-between
appointments in town -- a pleasant brunch with Eunice at the landmark
Naam vegetarian restaurant, and a dinner with F&amp;amp;T's small group at the
well-recommended Greek restaurant "Cosmos" in White Rock. This weekend
being Canadian Thanksgiving, I have six social meals scheduled -- lunch
and dinner on each of Saturday, Sunday, and Monday! I suppose I am
following the tradition of eating a lot on Thanksgiving ... a festival
of gratitude turned into a shrine of gluttony?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I have two appointments in town like this, separated by a few
hours, I have a decision to make whether it's worthwhile driving home
and back out again, especially through traffic. So today, I decided I
could spend some nice Sabbath time just resting and praying in my car.
I'm parked here in a nice part of town, a small cul-de-sac in Kitsilano,
at the end of a little alleyway with a nice view of English Bay and West
Vancouver. The mist falls softly, beads of water slowly accumulating on
my windshield. A few blocks behind me comes the occasional sound of cars
swishing by on the wet pavement. Perfect nap weather!&lt;/p&gt;

used to be called "Iron Chef" something, but they changed their name,
probably due to trademarks!). Fort Langley is so close to Trinity; it's
a great place to go for food on days like today when I forget to pack my
lunch. The main street, Glover Road, is perfect for taking a stroll on
sunny summer days. Today, it's a typical autumn day in the Lower
Mainland -- cloudy and drizzly, full of soft light and the soothing
patter of rain. On the maple trees outside, the light just seems to fall
into the matte orange leaves; no specular reflection whatsoever -- it's
an oddity of photonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere here at Sushi Ichi is quiet and content, like a home that
is at peace. The window dressings, cozy spaces, and wall mouldings lend
it a bed-and-breakfast feel. Soft piano hymns waft in the air. It's a
great place for an intimate conversation between friends. The staff are
always friendly and never seem rushed. I chat with the owner a bit in
Mandarin and Taiwanese; she attends a local charismatic church. Her kids
are off school today, and in a few minutes they come bounding in, all
chatter and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good lunch; a good day.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know what exactly
went wrong, but I was just off-kilter the whole day, and I felt awful
for those who were depending on me! I think maybe I didn't spend enough
"unhurried" time in my devotions that morning, or didn't use my Saturday
to rest properly for a Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright and early at 8:30am I dropped by my own church just to prepare
and pray, since I'd be serving elsewhere this week and wouldn't have a
chance to attend service or Sunday school here. I ran across a local
traveling preacher, who has visited our church several times but doesn't
claim any church as his home, just shows up uninvited wanting to preach
and heal and bring "deliverance". Just talking with him was a bit
stressful, but it reminded me that when I first showed up at my church,
uninvited, people were wary of me for the same reason -- and there was a
heightened sensitivity because of visitors like him. I've learned that
to be considerate and sensitive to others, I need not to take matters
into my own hands, but to sit back and let others get used to me in
their own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9:30 I was back with my old friends at SVPG church: it's been a
couple months since I saw them last, and it really saddened me to see
Pastor Justin with tired, slumped shoulders. He asked for prayer for
renewed vigor and focus, and I got the feeling that, indeed, the
congregation was looking to me to speak inspiration into their lives
with renewed vigor and focus. But I really didn't have it in me: I
myself was tired, drained, and under-prepared -- I felt like my message
on Philippians 2:12-16 was rambling and disorganized, and I openly
confessed that. But the Word of God is stronger than my shortcomings,
and God's power is made perfect in my weakness. To the extent that
anyone got anything out of that sermon, it's all due to the power of
God's Word -- it definitely wasn't me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I was back at the teens' baptismal Sunday school class
at Surrey ECBC. Just seeing their smiling faces as they played and joked
around was enough to brighten my day! But still I was tired and
unfocused; I noticed myself slipping into a more top-down didactic style
rather than interactive dialogue. I had a bit of trouble translating the
questions the kids asked in Mandarin, and I caught myself almost getting
a bit snippy with the kids. That just devastated me! These are the same
inquisitive kids from last week, and the last thing I want is to dump
cold water on their pursuit of God just because I'm having a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;

So
I've been asked to teach a baptismal preparation class for the teens at
Surrey &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecbc.org/"&gt;ECBC&lt;/a&gt;, every week from now until
December -- today was the first week. I'm super-excited about it, and
all the more excited when I got to see the kids today! :) Twenty-one
kids showed -- not all are ready for baptism, and a couple have already
been baptized -- but still, I think we'll have at least 8-10 who are
really serious about getting baptized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more wonderful was the questions they were asking during class --
deep, insightful, challenging, thought-provoking questions like, "is
there an unforgivable sin?", "will babies who die in infancy go to
hell?", "what about capital punishment?", "can Christians join the
military?", "are ghosts real?", "what about Catholics vs. Protestants
and the Reformation?", and much much more. And these kids are 12-13-14
years old! So insightful! Yeah, we didn't get even halfway through the
curriculum for today, but hey these questions are the stuff of which
Sunday school is made!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so heartwarming: after class, two boys of about 12 years old came
up to me, speaking in Mandarin (which I'm a bit flaky in). During the
class, initially they had kind of a poor attitude, reading a Harry
Potter novel and flinging pens around until I admonished them. Later on,
they became a constant stream of questions -- some apropos, some
tangential, but always deep. So I was quite surprised when, after class,
one of them confided to me: "All my life I have always hated teachers. I
have never liked a single teacher. You are the first teacher that made
me really want to come back next week." Wow! Glory be to God!&lt;/p&gt;

organized by the Christian Social Concern Fellowship, hosted by CCM. The
primary speaker was a Chinese pastor from Toronto, Rev. Dominic Tse, but
the focus was on having compassion and being involved ("incarnate," to
use a word that I feel is often abused) in the local Canadian community.
We had a small, cozy group of about 20 English-speaking Chinese, teens
and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was kind of an interesting experience for me, participating in a kind
of ministry that I don't often have direct interaction with, broadening
my horizons a bit. It also was an odd feeling for me when they always
insisted on addressing me as "Dr. Ho". :) I had a great conversation
over dinner with Brian Roodnick from West Point Grey Academy; it was
delightful to gather insight from an experienced fellow teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

The kids were
hilarious and surprising and heartwarming and precious, and the
partnership and coworking with Pastor Dave went so smoothly -- we "tag
teamed" really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ach, but there is a hidden cost to all these retreats -- the travel!
Hanging out with the kids and speaking God's truth into their lives is
so energizing and rewarding, but the &lt;em&gt;travel&lt;/em&gt; -- ohh, that's tiring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, after sitting in the San Jose airport for five hours while
waiting for our inbound plane to arrive after a mechanical problem, we
finally got on our flight to Seattle, arriving past 1am. Of course, at
that time, there weren't any connecting flights up to Vancouver, so I
was stuck in Seattle, in the middle of the night. But I needed to get to
Langley by 9am the next morning for work, so I did what any crazy
traveler would do -- I rented a car and drove myself up, airport to
airport, from 2am until about 4:30am! At least I didn't have to worry
about traffic at that hour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was taken somewhere outside of Bellingham -- yes, it was kind
of hard to drive at 120kph while looking through the viewfinder and
trying to hold the camera steady for 1/6th of a second in the dark! I
noticed an interesting thing about myself when I'm really tired: I could
accomplish various autonomic functions without difficulty -- driving,
watching for potholes, crossing the border, even pulling out the correct
drivers' license when I got pulled over (it was just a warning). But the
higher-order, executive functions of my brain just shut down --
somewhere around Redmond, I came to and wondered, "hey, which state am I
in? For that matter, which &lt;em&gt;country&lt;/em&gt; am I in?". :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after dropping off the rental car and picking up my own car
from YVR parking, I drove another hour home to Langley, collapsing in
bed around 5:30am. Enough time for a quick nap before getting up at 7:30
for work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's so wild, for the second year in a row CBBC church in Los Altos, CA
is holding their annual retreat at the Mission de Oro near Los Banos --
it's a Ramada Inn in the middle of nowhere, essentially a truck-stop off
I-5! But we had a great time; staying in a hotel was quite convenient
for the seniors, and the food wasn't half bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids were incredible, so creative and energetic, full of ideas and
full of initiative! As is par for the course at retreats like this, we
stayed up late on the last night of the retreat, gathered around a
little flashlight in lieu of a campfire, chatting about real-life
"ghost" stories (but greater is He that is in us than he that is in the
world!) and fielding some deep and honest questions about God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are shortly before we bid adieu to one another, with some of the
upper-classmen guys of the youth group. There's the youth pastor,
Dangerous Dave the Dare Devil, on the far right. I honestly have no idea
what Brett is doing in front.... :) With the rest of the guys and girls,
I think we had somewhere around 25 people on the English side!&lt;/p&gt;

so quickly; I am really under-prepared for it! I'm still recuperating
from all the retreats this summer -- seven so far, with one more to go
this coming weekend. And of course, so few of those are really
"retreats" for me, more like working camps! I think I've been
chronically sleep-deprived all summer, and right on the threshold of
getting sick. My mom observes that if I am seriously under-slept for
three days in a row, I get sick -- that's just one of those
peculiarities of my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to be teaching our MATH108 class again -- this is our
introductory statistics class for nursing students. The nursing students
are always so well motivated, eager to learn, and sweet; they are a joy
to teach. But this is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; math class they will ever take in
university, so I have my work cut out for me! This is our classroom; it
was recently renovated over the summer with new chalkboards and an LCD
projector (finally!) and sound system. Unfortunately, it was also
reduced in size -- we have to squeeze 45 MATH108 students in here!&lt;/p&gt;

small group members who is moving up to Richmond, working for Microsoft.
Well, any friend of Joyce's is a friend of mine, and when Joyce told me
how "protective" she gets over Eva, it somehow made me more protective
of her, as well! Although I know she's quite capable of taking care of
herself, but it's still a nice feeling to kind of take someone "under my
wing," even if only for a short time and in a small way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally, this weekend Eva's moving up here, together with her mom,
into a temporary rental apartment while she continues to look for a more
permanent place closer to work. The whole gang from Seattle came up to
help her settle in! We had a great time together -- a packed schedule,
but somehow still relaxed and enjoyable, everyone so comfortable with
one another. On this Labour Day, with Eva's stuff in place (only two
car-fuls), bank account set up, and enough groceries to feed a troop for
a week, we took a break to relax and do some touristy stuff -- here we
are at Prospect Point in Stanley Park, overlooking North Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

been shuffled here to the new Richmond office for the next year or so.
Microsoft has graciously put her up in temporary housing for a month, so
she has a bit of time to find a place and get settled in Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside is the temporary housing is in a beautiful and central
location right on the banks of False Creek, near the heart of Vancouver.
The building is a bit old, but it is evident that it was top-of-the-line
when it was first built! This area is prime real estate and some of the
most expensive land in the nation. The property manager said that if we
were to rent this place for ourselves, we'd be paying nearly CAD$4500 a
month! yipes! It's a good thing this month is on Microsoft's bill, and
Eva won't be staying here for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Creek is convenient to Vancouver, but actually
quite &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;convenient to work -- Eva's commute home during rush-hour
takes 40mins to an hour! She'll be looking for an apartment in Richmond,
closer to work.&lt;/p&gt;

area -- I'm still indebted to Dan for finding me my cozy little Finley
Forest condo in North Carolina! So I'm more than happy to be a bit of
Eva's eyes and ears in Richmond. The landlady at this place was a kindly
middle-aged Hong Kong lady; she was quite happy to speak Mandarin with
me (ah, my Cantonese is severely lacking), and quite eager to get a
quiet single Taiwanese lady for a tenant. The inside of this shower
looked pretty awful, though, lots of mould in the lower corners,
indicative of poor drainage. And the kitchenette was abysmal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a pretty packed and tiring day for me; at this point in the
day I hadn't had time to eat anything yet, except for a couple cookies
from the faculty meeting! I notice that I start forgetting little things
more when I don't eat or sleep enough. .... umm, what was I saying
earlier? ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I am so grateful to God for every breath, and for the fact
that I do have food available (if only I take time to eat it!). This
morning, during a break in that three-hour faculty meeting, a colleague
of mine whom I respect dearly, and who is usually so strong and brash,
really surprised me. Right in the middle of the crowded, noisy hallway,
she kinda broke down in front of me, sharing tearfully about her
stresses at home at and work. My heart goes out to her, but I really had
no idea what to say -- and she probably didn't need me to say anything
at all. But I pray for her, for God's peace and strength, and I am
reminded that there are so many who have gone through so much pain; I
hope I can be a small glimmer of a reflection of the love and compassion
that comes from Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

retreat to refocus our hearts and gear us up for the coming school year.
The lovely grounds here at Cedar Springs in Sumas, WA have served us
well for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I was unable to attend the faculty retreat due to my ongoing
immigration application; the year before that was my first one, and
rather overwhelming with the fairly cerebral discussion material and
somewhat arcane terminology. But this year's retreat was much more
personal and warm in tone, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the talks by our peers were simply honest and vulnerable
sharings of personal struggles and trials. I found it so refreshing --
still tiring, along with the several other retreats I've had this year
-- but refreshing nonetheless. It certainly has provided a lot to think
about. I got a stern-but-gentle talking-to by a couple of my more
motherly colleagues, pushing me to be a little more proactive and
intentional in finding a wife....&lt;/p&gt;

-- the primary purpose of the trip was for a memorial service for my
uncle, who recently passed away in Seattle. Extended-family gatherings
are more and more difficult as the years pass; our clan gets larger and
more disperse. It was so nice to see the uncles and aunts, and the
handful of cousins, who came to the memorial service, but our time
together was really short, only a few hours for most of them before they
had to catch their flights. The day was such a rushed jumble of emotions
that I didn't think to snap a picture at the memorial service. But my
sister's family stayed an extra day, so the next day we went to the
Science Center and Space Needle to do some touristy stuff with the kids.
The weather was the cloudy-drizzly nap weather typical of Seattle -- but
at least there weren't big crowds!&lt;/p&gt;

Uncle Paul is my mom's little brother -- can you see the resemblance?
It's actually the second time in recent weeks that I've gotten to have
lunch with them -- part of the reason we got together was so that I
could bring them a couple copies of my mom's books, but unfortunately, I
totally forgot to bring the books last time! Absent-minded professor....
Well, it gave us another excuse to see them, and this time, my mom was
better at remembering the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncle Paul and Auntie Sarah entertained us with fun stories from their
whirlwind travels to all corners of the earth, illustrated with photos
on his new iPod video. Playing with rockhopper penguins in Antarctica,
hiking in Patagonia, riding camels in Arabia (the dromedaries are more
ornery and harder to ride than the bactrians), trying on dabs of real
frankincense from a frankincense tree -- they had lots of stories to
tell! Mostly, though, it was just nice simply to see family again, just
to see their faces and be together.&lt;/p&gt;

churning in my head about church ... it happens to me all the time on
Saturday nights! It seems nearly every week before church I get a bit
stressed. I think I really need to spend more Sabbath time on Saturdays
in worship in solitude to prepare my heart for corporate worship on
Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying awake in the pre-dawn stillness, I had a rather simple epiphany: a
thought, an analysis, an evaluation which makes things "click" for me:
we are a &lt;em&gt;Martha church.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village
where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister
called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.
But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be
made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my
sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset
about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen
what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke10:38-42"&gt;(Luke
10:38-42)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone, of course, and not all the time, but it seems that so
often in a big church the sheer organizational logistics of herding so
many sheep stack up so many &lt;em&gt;tasks&lt;/em&gt;, to-do items, sign-up sheets,
sub-committees, and taskforce teams that we lose sight of the goal, the
whole point of why we're here in the first place. We're focused on
getting the job done &lt;em&gt;efficiently&lt;/em&gt; -- to make it through the event,
clean up, pack up, say "job well done," and go home. But what was the
point? Have we changed, grown closer to Christ, or drawn others closer
to Christ? Or have we simply added another bullet-point to our
"spiritual résumé"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I will pray this prayer -- it is a risky, controversial,
divisive prayer, and really it's up to God to answer as He sees fit --
but when I have the guts, I pray this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sovereign Lord God, shut us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machinery and system of church that we have devised in the
traditions of man -- jam the cogs and stop us in our tracks. Break
us and bring us to our knees before You, helpless and completely
without recourse. Take us back to our first love -- You, and nothing
else. We resolve to know nothing except Christ and You crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For You, Jesus Christ, You alone are our Creator, our Redeemer, our
Resurrection and Life, and our coming King.&lt;/p&gt;

by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ccmcanada.org/"&gt;CCM&lt;/a&gt;: it is always a joy to work with
kids, and camps are inevitably tremendously enjoyable, rewarding,
exhausting, and challenging! This camp will be my fourth one this
summer, I think, with two more to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen, on the ball as usual, many months ago set the overall theme
("Missing Pieces") and the focus for my evening talks ("integrity"). But
I needed to set aside some time to focus and prepare spiritually for the
weekend, so here I am on the banks of the Fraser, in the cool shade of
the willows, praying through my devotions in Genesis15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to analyze my sermon-preparation methodology, and how
it has changed over the years. I am still tempted to jump right into
the &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt; of the talk, the obligatory three-point outline and
PowerPoint bulleted lists. I can easily get distracted with slick
animated transitions and pretty clipart -- it's a bottomless time-sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the preparation I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need is to make sure my heart is in
line with God's -- to confess my struggles to Him, to cast my cares upon
Him, and to lift my eyes to the heavens, to the Saviour who calls me to
His service according to His purpose and power. When my spirit is
attentive to the quiet voice of the Holy Spirit, then the message,
outline, anecdotes, and everything else fall into place very naturally!
The times I get into trouble are when my own agenda and pride get in the
way of God's working. :) My reflections carry me to God's covenant
promise to Abram, when he was a sojourner in a foreign land, and still
childless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;[God] took him outside and said, "Look up at the heavens and count
the stars -- if indeed you can count them."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Then He said to him, "So shall your offspring be."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=Gen15:5"&gt;(Genesis
15:5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To behold the natural beauty of creation, whether the brilliant stars in
the inky night sky or the soft breeze now whispering against my cheek,
is to behold a testimony of the glory of the Creator. The same God who
made each star and calls them by name also calls me by name and cares
for me, small and insignificant though I may be. He provided a son and a
legacy for Abram; and if it is His will, He will provide a family for
me, too -- in His timing. I just need to continue in the faith that
Abram had: simply to take God at His word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as
righteousness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=Gen15:6"&gt;(Genesis

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

upcoming youth leadership camp. CCM has a huge office space right in the
middle of Crystal Mall (right behind the food court!), a prime location
to reach many Chinese in the area, and they've got a heart for outreach
and "pre"-evangelism. Allen has been working hard on their youth and
children's ministries, and for this leadership camp we've got 30 teens
and young adults signed up already -- with about a third of them
non-Christians! We're excited for this outreach opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most humbling for me at this planning meeting was the realization that
I'm the oldest person there -- and I'm supposed to be the source of wise
counsel! Still, it was so encouraging and humbling to see these young
people, down to grade-11, so gifted and dedicated, enthusiastic and

&lt;p&gt;It's been such fun for me, this summer I've been on a series of several
"dates" with church people -- &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/lunch-with-auntie-a"&gt;Auntie
"A"&lt;/a&gt;, guys from small group, pastors, etc.
-- spending casual, unhurried, one-on-one time with no agenda other than
to get to know one another better, to "hear your story". I've had a
blast, learned a lot, gained an appreciation for people, became better
equipped to see things from their perspective, learned how to pray more
specifically for them. I think it's really helped me develop that
"splagchna" -- translated "tenderness" in Philippians 2:1, a gut
emotional compassion for one another. It makes it much harder to
pre-judge or stereotype people, and I think it makes it a lot easier to
serve together in the church. Plus, it's just a lot of fun! Of course,
things get more complicated when it's with a single woman -- although I
wish that it weren't so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave and I aren't in the same small group, so although we see each other
often at church, we haven't ever had a chance to chat one-on-one --
until today! Here we are on the tiny little Albion Ferry. We had lunch
close by in Fort Langley and just walked on (free ride!) and took the
short ride over to Maple Ridge (the Fraser River is so narrow, the ferry
practically just turns around to reach the other side!). The ferry
offered a little respite from the voracious mosquitoes!&lt;/p&gt;

I think speaking is less work than coordinating, being MC, song leading,
setting up chairs, etc.!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our small group has been having some good discussions, both in person
and over email, about hard-hitting topics. Below is a snippet from an
email I sent in response to a question about homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oh, and the photo doesn't really relate to anything; it's just my happy
little poinsetta, still green even seven months after Christmas!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoo, we're hitting the good topics! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is useful to define terms first -- what do we mean by
homosexuality, sexuality, sexual orientation, gay marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1960s our society has, I believe, become overly sexualized, to
the point where people's self-identity is excessively defined by
sexuality. Those who self-label themselves into "the LBGT community"
(lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgendered) are, by so doing, defining
themselves in terms of sexuality. Conversely, the conservative church so
often brands people according to their sexual sins. Would we do the same
with other sins? Would we say, "oh, she's an unrepentant gossiper; we
can't let her be a member," or even (in a somewhat patronizing tone),
"yeah, one of my coworkers is an Angry Man, so I know a bit about the
Angry Man community: here's what the Angry Men are thinking...." My
point is that in labeling/stereotyping we are implicitly creating an
us-vs.-them divide. But the divide that really matters is not between
"heterosexual" vs. "homosexual" (terms which I'll define momentarily),
but between saved vs. unsaved, following Christ vs. not following
Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, sexuality is an important part of humanity, and I think
the traditional church has often viewed sex as a "taboo" subject, and in
so doing has irresponsibly abdicated its mandate to teach the Biblical
principles to the next generation. God made sex to be a precious,
beautiful gift to married couples -- and He defined marriage to be one
man and one woman for life. Completely apart from any hermeneutics of
Leviticus or Romans, God's stance on sexuality is implicit in the
definition of marriage -- and hence the definition of adultery, which is
any sexual relationship outside of marriage. The sexual drive which is
in all of us is placed there by God; its purpose is for within marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like all other gifts from God, sexual drive/desire can be
corrupted -- even without any apparent conscious decision on our part --
simply because of our sinful nature, because of the fallenness of all
creation, and because of Satan's attacks. We all can be tempted to think
lustful thoughts about a member of the same sex; we all can be tempted
to think lustful thoughts about a member of the opposite sex. In this
sense sexual "orientation" may be defined as a predisposition to be
tempted to think lustful thoughts about one sex more than about the
other. Lustful thoughts, no matter what orientation, are sin, tantamount
to adultery, according to the Sermon on the Mount. Even marriage is not
a license to go wild -- lustful thoughts about my own wife are still sin
-- I need to honour God foremost in my thoughts, and honour my wife
also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because we are predisposed to sin does not mean that we should give
in to sin. We don't always have a choice how we are tempted, but we do
always have a choice how we respond to the temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a further dimension which complicates the issue: love. Another
aspect of the over-sexualization of our society is the false equating of
love with sex. I've heard people say, "if God is love, then why would He
deny me and my [gay, monogamous] partner true love?". The issue is: what
is love, and who defines it? In the Bible, David and Jonathan loved each
other very deeply, without any sexual connotations. Jesus loved His
disciples -- Scripture even highlights the apostle John as "the disciple
whom He loved" -- but certainly without any sexual aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern masculinity has become so over-sexualized that heterosexual men
are often afraid to develop these kinds of intimate friendships with
other men, for fear that it would mean they're gay. Conversely, many gay
men freely develop intimate same-sex friendships, but mistakenly think
that such friendships must become sexual. The need to love and be loved
is inherent in all of us; it is a good thing; it can only be satisfied
by God, the author of love and the One who defines it.&lt;/p&gt;

me as I've tried to find a place in VCAC. He recommended that Auntie "A"
and I sit down and have a chat, so today we had a long lunch at a nice
seafood place in Richmond. Auntie A is a pillar of the church at KS and
has been here for quite a while. She's a little younger than my mom,
came to the U.S. about the same time; I'm about the same age as her
sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ours was a pleasant conversation: Auntie A was very sweet and reminisced
of simpler times when she was a foreign student, when the church
fellowship was just about their only family on this side of the world.
She noted, and I agree, that our generation often doesn't have these
kinds of long-lasting close relationships -- childhood friends that
you've known for twenty years or more, whose parents were friends with
your parents. There are still a number of those families around at KS,
the "olde guard", who remember when the church was smaller and less
bureaucratic, when people cared and wanted to serve for the joy of it
rather than out of obligation, when the choir was strong and everyone
sang like they really meant it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that kind of a church, and I grew up with a church family
like that -- but it was a different family, in a different city. Coming
here, to this city, to this church, where no one knows me or my family
-- I have no roots here, but VCAC is a church with roots, and close-knit
ones, at that. Thinking over this now, I begin to wonder if maybe
it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have been easier had I moved back to my hometown, to the
place of my roots. But I know that Seattle has changed much in the last
ten years, and many of my childhood friends have moved on: other cities,
other churches, other lives. And, in all likelihood, I've moved on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver is teeming with rootless young adults, and more flow in each
year. There are rootless, hip, young churches/ministries that cater to
this crowd, and I know I would fit in easily with them. And in a way,
those foreign-student fellowships of yesteryear in which lifelong
friendships were forged -- those were rootless, too:
they &lt;em&gt;established&lt;/em&gt; roots by choosing to spend critical years of their
lives together. But I don't think that I would voluntarily move to such
a church; I think we gain so much more by reconciling in Christ and
learning from each other -- older generations and younger, English
congregations and Chinese congregations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into this lunch, I had planned to talk primarily about the church,
to hear from Auntie A about its history, what events and issues that
have shaped its character. But somehow or other, we ended up talking
more about dating and marriage -- and "settling down". She counseled me
not to worry so much about the big issues of church politics -- I can't
fix the church, so why worry about things I can't do anything about? Her
advice was to start small and just enjoy the fellowship and community at
church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, she added, if I want to get married, I need to stay in one place
and spend the time to get to know people and be known. The single women
at KS, Auntie A observed, are mostly neither flashy nor highly educated,
but they are quite gentle and peaceable, and very sweet once you get to
know them. I concur!  But what remains to be seen is whether I'd be a
good match with such a person, or whether I need to change my
character/personality, or whether I need to look elsewhere, or none of
the above, or all of the above. I really don't know; I seek God's
guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard, though, for me to sit still week after week just attending
(1) worship service, (2) Sunday School, (3) prayer meeting, and (4)
small group, like I once was told to do. Merely to sit through a fluffy
sermon, a sleepy, uni-directional Sunday School, a sparse prayer
meeting, and a small group disconnected from the church -- I'm not
content! I've seen Christendom outside VCAC, I've seen vibrant churches
that are really alive in the Spirit -- indeed, it sounds like
VCAC &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to have that life in its first generation. We have so much
potential, so much raw material: I see what we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;be, under
God's hand. And I &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; about our people: I care about the faithful
few who are so burnt out, frustrated, cynical, and under-appreciated. I
care about the disconnected many who are so talented, thirsty,
ill-equipped, and also under-appreciated. I want them all to experience
release and joy and trust -- letting go into God's mighty hands -- being
built up by encouragement, not guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a fire in my soul, and what I see as more important than merely
filling the Sunday School teachers' roster is the &lt;em&gt;atmosphere&lt;/em&gt; and
character of our church -- our heart-attitude toward ministry, toward
people, indeed, toward God. As the old hymn celebrates: there is joy in
serving Jesus! Do we show it? Do we share it?&lt;/p&gt;

Sundays at 3pm, which means that folks are free to help out with teens
fellowships on Friday nights or AWANA on Saturday nights. This afternoon
we had our Bible study out in the park under the dappled shade of pine
trees. The weather was just perfect for a lovely stroll around the park.
Our topic these past few weeks has been "tests to see if you're a true
Christian", from a chapter in John MacArthur's book, "Saved Without a
Doubt". Our discussions are always intense! But we had a good
interaction today, I think; pretty much everyone contributed something
to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't quite put my finger on why, but I'm feeling more upbeat today
after church, even though I still see many of the same issues that
plague our church. Mo often bewails the watered-down gospel that is so
often preached in our church -- if we don't preach the wrath of God or
the depravity of man, then the grace of God is meaningless. To me, the
central problem that stands out is one of heart-attitude -- attitude
towards ministry, attitude towards people, attitude towards God. To top
it off, in recent weeks we've had letters of resignation from our
children's pastor and music director, and the congregations are getting
smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for some reason, I'm upbeat! I think it's because in the trials and
"pruning" of our church, I'm seeing more communication and
introspection, and an awareness that our current status quo is simply
not tenable. Change needs to happen, and we need to be on our knees
broken before God, crying out for His redemption of His bride. I'm
looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

little house. Here's my masterpiece meal for this morning -- a pound of
fresh halibut fillet, pan-seared in olive oil, together with a medley of
steamed broccoli, sweet yellow bell peppers, romaine lettuce, and
hot-house tomatoes. I didn't think very hard about the portions, though,
so I cooked way too much: it was a rather filling meal for me! It would

"Excellence" discipleship small group, newly started by Pastor Justin.
Nora brought four newborn orphan kittens to try to give away; they're so
adorable! Here PJ is settling the one male in his own box separate from
the females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at the large turnout tonight: sixteen people
ranging from high school to university to young parents, all excited
about being challenged and stretched to grow in their faith, wherever
they are in their walk with Christ. Pastor Justin has positioned the
group as "only for those who want to be challenged", who want to do
something extra to grow -- there's no obligation to join; it's okay to
not join and still be a good Christian. So the sixteen people who came
are a real answer to prayer! Tonight PJ preached passionately on
peacemaking, inspired by John 17:24 and Matthew 5:9. The sharing around
the table afterward was so honest and vulnerable; it was really quite
refreshing, and promising for the future growth of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

bit, I was free for the rest of the day, didn't have to give anyone a
ride home. The camp site is way out in Sasquatch Provincial Park, about
15 minutes north of the famous Harrison Hot Springs resort. I'd never
been here before, so I figured I'd cruise around a bit and enjoy the
warm weather. This is Deer Lake, nearby our campground -- that little
beach in centre frame is accessible via a short trail from our
campsites. One of the kids told me that he got up at 5am this morning
and walked down to that beach all by himself -- yipes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a few more hours at another beach on Harrison Lake, the
Greenspot day area -- munched a packed sandwich, took a nap on driftwood
on the sandy beach, played guitar, and soaked in the sunshine. The drive
home afterward was nice, too -- I had been warned about Highway 1
traffic due to the holiday weekend, so I took the winding and scenic
two-lane Lougheed Highway (Hwy 7), snacking on some delicious fresh BC
cherries. I was awfully tired -- even just from one day with the kids --

various retreats and camps all over the area! VCAC has three -- a
Chinese family camp, Teens' Camp, and Kidz' Kamp. These lovely and
energetic teens are from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ccgc-canada.org/"&gt;CCGC&lt;/a&gt;, with whom
I've been able to build up a relationship over the past couple years. I
thoroughly enjoyed hanging out with them at &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/ccgc-youth-tent-camping"&gt;last year's tent camping
trip&lt;/a&gt;. This year I was unable to be
their speaker, but I was still able to spend the last night overnight
with them, leading songs and sharing a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so amazed at how resourceful Pastor Lo is: he coordinated with a
church youth group way out in Texas to have a joint retreat here in
rural BC! 37 teens from CCGC, plus 24 teens from Texas, with only 11
adults, including a few parents who came mostly to take care of the
food. I have no idea how the two churches got connected....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are at the very end of the retreat, loaded on to the big yellow
school bus and ready to head home. The kids are tallying mosquito bites
like old battle scars. Look at those smiling faces; aren't they
cuuuuute??? :)&lt;/p&gt;

church; they've been so welcoming and seem to have a real thirst for
God's Word. As with many relationships, this one has developed over time
-- both chronological time (about a year, I think, with my family; about
six months with me directly) as well as &lt;em&gt;"kairos"&lt;/em&gt; time -- singular
events that move things forward, like speaking in their English service
and church retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I met with Pastors Matthew and Justin to discuss and pray over the
needs of their church and how I might be able to help out in some small
way. I am really honoured and humbled by their invitation and am looking
forward to preaching a short series here once a month, as well as
ministering to their leadership discipleship small group. After the
retreat, I think the bar has been set high -- their expectations of me
are pretty bold! But it's done in a good way, with an encouraging
spirit, and it's good accountability for me, pushing me to be in-depth
and faithful to Scripture, while also practical and challenging in
exhortation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do love this congregation, and I am looking forward not only that I
get to spend some time together with them, but also, hopefully, that I
can be of some benefit and encouragement to them in the Word of God! As
for my own church, I do still care very deeply about our people, and
there is such a pervasive need here for deeper Biblical teaching: I
really want to do something about it, but at this point I'm not in much
of a position to do that! I think these things have to come by God's
leading and by invitation, and I haven't "worked my way up the ladder"
at VCAC, so for now I guess I'll stick to serving behind the scenes, at
a grassroots level, one person at a time. I have to remind myself that I
cannot change the church: changing hearts is God's work!&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps it means I've
been less introspective/contemplative.... ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was supposed to speak to the teens at FL, but I ended up not
being needed, so I got a rare opportunity to sit through an entire
Sunday School class at KS! Here Julie is explaining some approaches to
conflict resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked back through my calendar, and much to my surprise I've only
been able to attend an entire KS SS class two other times this year, due
to teaching Sunday School at CCGC, preaching in Teens' Worship at VCAC,
preaching at SVPGC, and several retreats and other ministry
opportunities. I still consider VCAC my new "home base" church, and I
care very deeply about the people here, but it would be nice if it were
a bit more of a "sending" church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an excerpt from an email I sent recently asking two friends of
mine to help with worship; it touches on this topic of motivating by
encouragement rather than by guilt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is a very different mindset from the way our church works, I
want to reassert the reason why I invite you to worship along with me at
prayer meeting, and what my philosophy of ministry is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; us, but He &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; to use us despite our
weakness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; to serve Jesus, as it is He who wills and who works
in us, not our own strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because I've experienced this joy, I want to &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; it with
others!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how this philosophy plays out in the context of prayer meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't "need" you to play piano/sing (hey, we don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to sing
any songs at prayer meeting!) -- but I choose you, value you, and
appreciate you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I personally love worshiping in music, and I love worshiping together
as a team! It's what keeps me going, and it's in my blood! It takes
the focus off of myself and the church's problems, and onto Christ --
so refreshing and energizing and humbling! Same thing for prayer!
Gets me riled up and down on my knees!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love you guys, and want for you to enjoy a little bit of serving
God in a context of freedom and joy, rather than guilt and
obligation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't come to prayer meeting because you "have to", because
people are expecting you to, or because it's written into the membership
covenant. Please come because there is real joy and power when we are on
our knees before God, who alone can change hearts and revive our church.
Please come because our frustrations with the church (mine included) can
find release only as we cast our cares upon Jesus, when we pray together
as brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;take care! It is always a pleasure to see you!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;-- Sean&lt;/div&gt;

A blink, and
they've already changed so much since I last saw them, less than a year
ago. Here Isabel is wearing her little dress that her mom decorated for
her. Not too sure what she's doing with the bamboo stick; I think she's
rowing a gondola. She likes pretending to be Sleeping Beauty, neatly
laying on a blanket, hands tidily folded across her chest. A kiss from
either her father or me will wake her up -- but not from her little
brother, no matter how hard he tries!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed the trip: it was a welcome change of pace from life
up in BC -- no big agendas or hurried schedules, just peaceful, domestic
life. The late-night talks with my sister about church issues really
helped put things in perspective for me, and at the least reminded me
that the frustrations I get at my church are by no means unique: they
often simply come with the territory at large churches. I am still
really not sure what, if anything, I ought to do at church to help the
situation, but at least I have a renewed spirit to persevere and
continue seeking out God's open doors.&lt;/p&gt;

pump constantly circulates a flow of water. Movable plastic dividers
allow one to channel the water and float little toy boats. Lots of fun

about three hours of sleep, staying up late chatting with Tony, and
preparing songs and a sermon for Teens' Worship. So although the hike

tiring, sweet time of fellowship together! It was a real privilege and
joy to share the weekend and share God's Word with the English
congregation at SVPGMBC. (That's the South Vancouver Pacific Grace
Mennonite Brethren Church -- whew, quite a mouthful!) Our theme on both
the Chinese and English sides was the book of Philippians, "To Live is
Christ".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, the retreat location was at TWU: that made it rather easy
for me! I even got to go home after the late-night snack time, to sleep
in my nice soft bed with a down comforter in a quiet room, ahhh.... :)
Meanwhile poor Pastor Justin had to stay up into the wee hours of the
morning to keep the kids in their rooms. I've been retreat speaker and
camp counselor many many times, and being a camp counselor is much more
tiring than being a speaker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Pi fellowship is in the cafeteria celebrating Pastor
Justin+Yvonne's first anniversary by singing Lifehouse's "You and Me".
Carlin sang this song for them at their wedding one year ago; aww, how
sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young people here have such energy and enthusiasm to learn from the
Scriptures and serve in the church. I was so impressed to see that
nearly half of them already have a regular habit of personal devotions
with God -- the usual ratio for most churches I've spoken at is around
10-15%! Good job -- but still not good enough! ;) Need to read through
the entire Bible, cover-to-cover: it's our owner's manual for life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people, young and old, English side and Chinese side, shared with
me about some of the struggles and sorrows they had with church
politics; it both saddened and surprised me that they too are dealing
with these issues, just like my own church. But I was much heartened to
see that brothers and sisters from all corners of the church have a
heartfelt desire to bridge the gaps, to communicate with and understand
one another, and to work together for the kingdom of God. The
relationship is akin to that of a parent with a grown adult child -- and
strong families are the necessary building blocks for strong churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the Lord continue to grant them abounding love, in
knowledge &lt;em&gt;(epi-gnosis)&lt;/em&gt; and insight &lt;em&gt;(ais-thei-sis)&lt;/em&gt;, so that they
can approve &lt;em&gt;(doki-mazo)&lt;/em&gt; what is excellent &lt;em&gt;(dia-phero)&lt;/em&gt;, and stand
pure &lt;em&gt;(ei-li-krineis)&lt;/em&gt; and blameless &lt;em&gt;(apo-skopoi)&lt;/em&gt; in the day of
Christ. With God's help, I know that they will be able to discern the
majors from the minors, to speak boldly of the gospel, and to persevere
in unity under the banner of Jesus Christ!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm at the Save-On Foods grocery store just
a block away from my house, stocking up on my supply of iced tea, and
I'm waiting in line at the check-out. It's really crowded and busy
today, and the lines are moving slowly. I'm almost to the front of the
line; the cashier is doing her best but looks really tired and
over-worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, out of the blue, I get this clear, powerful prompting to pray for
this cashier. Her name tag reads, "Sharon": she looks to be in her upper
thirties, heavy-set, her eyes, shoulders, posture, all drooping. She
looks frustrated, drained. I try to ignore the prompting within me, but
it is unmistakable: I need to be praying for this lady, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, God, sure I can always pray for the people around me, but do I have
to &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; to her about it? Can't I just pray &lt;em&gt;silently&lt;/em&gt;? I struggle
and hesitate, and in those 20 seconds she's already finished scanning
and is waiting for me to sign the credit card slip. OK, here I go. As I
sign the slip and push it back, I stammer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ca.. can I pray for you?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both she and the bag-boy stop and give me a look that says so
clearly, &lt;em&gt;"What are you, a fool?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try again: "Would it be all right if I prayed for you?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She annoyedly replies, "I'm busy here!", waving her hands at the
groceries piling up before her. The bag-boy looks away. I nod and
hastily gather up my things, thinking to myself, "well, duh, that's the
response any &lt;em&gt;sane&lt;/em&gt; person would have in this situation!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside in the parking lot, in the beautiful sunshine and cool breeze, I
stop and pray: What just happened here? What was the point of that? I
failed actually to pray with her -- so Lord, why did you nudge me like
that? Lord Jesus, I pray for Sharon. Grant her an extra measure of your
comfort and peace, that she would be able to find joy even in a trying
job; that she would be able to enjoy a bit of the sunshine today, even
if only a glimpse through the store windows. I pray that through one
means or another, she would hear of and know that there is a God in
heaven, the Saviour Jesus Christ, who loves her and wants to redeem her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for me, I am reminded that God is working in the lives of the
people all around me every day, whether I'm aware of it or not -- so I
need to be prepared, I need to open up my eyes and my heart, I need to
keep in step with the Spirit, bearing its fruit in my character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=Gal5:25"&gt;(Galatians
5:25)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack that's been running through my head this week is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://songs.seanho.com/everything.html"&gt;Tim
Hughes' "Everything"&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://songs.seanho.com/mp3/everything.mp3"&gt;(mp3)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;God in my living, there in my breathing,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;God in my waking, God in my sleeping;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;God in my resting, there in my working,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;God in my thinking, God in my speaking,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Be my everything, be my everything&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must glorify God and bear witness to Him in everything I do -- when
I'm grocery shopping, when I'm driving in rush-hour traffic, when I'm
eating lunch with friends after church. The heavens tell of the glory of
God; the whole earth is the cathedral for His worship -- and I will
praise Him in it!&lt;/p&gt;

tonight they took an expedition out to UBC's Chan Centre to see the
Vancouver Symphony. I didn't attend the conference, but I'm always up
for the VSO, and the company was enjoyable, chatting with literary
academics who know their stuff and appreciate good music. :) Tonight was
special -- all six Brandenburg concertos in one sitting! The setting was
intimate, more chamber than orchestral, and highlighted the elegant
"conversation in counterpoint" of Bach. Even the musicians' attire
reflected this: rather than the traditional all-black uniform, each
member had a shirt or blouse of a different bright colour. Bach's
effortless fluid motion from one instrument to another paints a
beautiful picture of teamwork -- each member is unique, not a
replaceable automaton, but they work together to lift each other up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week I've really been out of it, not really able to focus,
kinda frustrated at church, frustrated at myself. So when I dropped
south of the border for my weekly gas fill-up, I decided to stay a bit
longer and enjoy the afternoon sun on Birch Bay. A nice long walk on the
beach is always good for soothing me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birch Bay is a quiet little community of mostly rental beach houses,
lined up along the semicircular waterfront. It's so small that it's not
actually a town of its own: officially, it's just part of Blaine. The
exclusive and
ultra-expensive &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/semiahmoo-beach-and-drayton-harbor"&gt;Semiahmoo&lt;/a&gt;
resort community and country club lies to the north, but Birch Bay
itself is still accessible to the "everyman": there are large 4x4 trucks
and Harley motorcycles parked outside the pubs and fish-'n-chips
restaurants. This afternoon, the tide is partially out, and there are a
few young families out clam-digging in the muddy flats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pick up a bottle of iced tea at the corner store, park the car, and
trek out along the rocky beach -- no particular destination in mind, but
still intent on walking, moving, going forward. The beach here is not
the nice soft sand of &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/acadia-beach-at-low-tide"&gt;Acadia
beach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/29-times-around-the-sun"&gt;Jericho
beach&lt;/a&gt;: it is rocky and uneven, and
slippery with seaweed. The hard rocks poke into my feet, even through my
sandals. I walk with my head down, focused on the next step in front of
me, pushing on. The pebbles and barnacles crackle loudly beneath my
feet: &lt;em&gt;crunch, crunch, crunch&lt;/em&gt;. It is hard work; I must stay the
course and persevere. But I realize I'm not so much headed &lt;em&gt;toward&lt;/em&gt;
anything as much as I am simply headed &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; -- away from my car,
away from Vancouver -- and, perhaps, away from my problems and
frustrations there. As seems to be a trend for me, it takes some time,
whether on the road or on foot, before I've "de-stressed" enough to
think and take stock of where I am and what's bothering me. Today, by
the time I pause to look back, I'm surprised to see that I've walked
nearly two miles down the beach; my car is a speck in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stop moving, the sudden silence is startling: there is no
traffic, there are no voices, not even any wind, just a few seagulls
calling, off in the distance. I suddenly think of the story of Elijah
in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=1Ki19"&gt;I Kings
19&lt;/a&gt;,
when he is hiding out in a cave, physically and emotionally drained,
despairing of life. In the stillness and through the sound of a gentle
blowing, God asks Elijah:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What are you doing here, Elijah?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=1Ki19:9"&gt;(I Kings
19:9)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, just maybe, God is asking me the same question: What are you
doing here? Why are you running away? Don't you trust that I have a plan
for you? There's work left to be done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't believe how quickly I messed things up at church, ruffled
feathers, and even got a few people to not really be on speaking terms
with me -- all just in my first few months here! First impressions go a
long way -- and bad first impressions mean a deficit of trust that takes
a long time to pay back. I was over-eager, a bit naïve, I didn't know
the "rules of engagement" at this church ... and I certainly didn't
expect such a strong reaction. So for the past few months I've been
trying to hide a bit, lay low, make less waves. A friend who was praying
for me last night mentioned the phrase, "shaken confidence", and I think
that's apt -- my confidence really has been shaken. In a church as big
as ours it wouldn't be hard for me to avoid certain people -- attend the
other campus, stay out of certain ministries; it's pretty easy. And
perhaps it is better for those ministries if I stay away from them, I
dunno. But I know that running away won't solve problems; shutting down
lines of communication will only make things worse. From my quiet time
last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Pursue peace with all men,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=Heb12:14"&gt;(Hebrews
12:14)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, from my quiet time this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For, the one who desires life, to love and see good days,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;He must turn away from evil and do good;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;He must seek peace and pursue it,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;for the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and His ears attend to their prayer,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=1Pet3:10-12"&gt;I Peter
3:10-12&lt;/a&gt;,
quoting &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=Ps34:12-16"&gt;Psalm
34:12-16&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real peace does not mean avoiding conflict, insulating myself, or
excluding "problem people" -- real peace means coming together in
humility and in prayer, on the common ground of Scripture, under the
common authority of our Father in heaven. Real peace takes hard work:
real peace is &lt;em&gt;pursued&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thankful for the encouragement of another friend of mine: I had
been sharing how lately I'd been a bit afraid to introduce myself to new
people and chat before/after Sunday service, for fear that people would
again ask, "Why are you here?", or "Why are you talking to them?" -- as
though I had some nefarious ulterior motive why I wanted to get to know
people. Much simpler just to keep quiet and pray by myself, just like
everyone else does. "But," countered my friend, "isn't that just
contributing to the problem of our church not being welcoming? If you
know it's right to reach out to people, then shouldn't you do it
anyway?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;yes! I think he's right. And although it's not in my nature to
approach random strangers and introduce myself -- it's not in anyone's
nature -- but I've trained up in myself the discipline of doing just
that, and I think now I just need to keep reaching out: with tact and
sensitivity, but without fear.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I need to get back in the game.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great
reward.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the
will of God, you may receive what was promised.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=Heb10:35-36"&gt;(Hebrews
10:35-36)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Postscript):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;One of the drawbacks of waiting for the beautiful sunset during the
summertime this far north is that the sun sets pretty late in the
evening! By the time I walked the two miles back to my car in the
twilight, I was getting pretty hungry, but all the restaurants were
closed -- except for the pubs, which were wailing with awful karaoke
music. I ended up driving back home and cooking up a yummy halibut
fillet for dinner -- at 11pm!﻿&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's quite nice how my birthday falls just after the close of the school
year, so that I do actually have a chance to rest and reflect. I like
going to the beach to think and pray: something about the water and the
long sight-lines is so soothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I drove clear across town to Jericho Beach on Point Grey; I
remember &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/acadia-beach-at-low-tide"&gt;walking barefoot on the sandflats of nearby Acadia Beach
last year&lt;/a&gt;. As I park the car and
meander on foot along the waterfront, the weather around me today is
breathtakingly, paradoxically, beautiful. It is bright and sunny with
the promise of summertime, but it is yet still brisk with the chill wind
of winter. Above me and towards the ocean, the sky is cloudless blue;
above the city and towards the mountains, it is dark and cloudy. In the
distance fall long vertical lines of rain. When I stand still, the
sunshine warms my face even as the arctic breeze makes me shiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down the pathway, there is an enclosed shipyard storing hundreds
of small sailboats, and wafting from it is a light tinkling melody that
sounds like windchimes. I think it rather odd, until I draw closer and
realize that it is actually the sound of rigging, clanging against
hundreds of hollow aluminum masts! What lovely music! There are a few
other people out at the beach on this Friday afternoon, but for now I am
alone with my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday school at KS these few weeks has had a guest speaker, Paul
Stevens, talking about dating and marriage: I think it's been really
good! A lot of people from FL came over especially for these talks; we
had probably 70-80 people in the basement of KS. It's only natural, I
suppose, for me to be thinking a lot about these things. I have a lot of
head knowledge about the right things to do, but when the heart gets
involved I suppose it's a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We certainly don't teach enough in the church about proper
dating/courtship. I know of more than one Chinese church that was so
afraid of their kids dating that they made rules (explicit or implicit)
against dating within the youth group. The problem is that it doesn't
prevent kids from dating -- it just means they start dating
non-Christians outside the youth group! I think the churches simply find
it easier to make rules than really to study the Scriptures, take a
defensible stance, and teach with compassion and full conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the beach, I stop at a strategic park bench to do my devotionals:
the bench is somewhat sheltered from the wind, but still warmed by the
sun. :) My quiet time today is from I Peter 1, but the first time I read
through it, somehow it doesn't seem to register in my mind: I am still
thinking of other things. I flip ahead a few pages and see that indeed,
chapter 3 does talk about family and marriage -- but only after
reaffirming basic theology in chapter 1. I'm eager to get to ch3's
verses on husband and wife roles, but first I come up against this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a
living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are
protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready
to be revealed in the last time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=1Pe1:3-5"&gt;(I Peter 1:3-5,
NASB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this passage here? Why does it come first? Through the fog in my
brain these verses sound a piercing clarion bringing me back to the
solid assurance we have in Christ -- our living hope, our future
inheritance, and our present calling. The calling of Jesus Christ takes
primacy! Everything else, even marriage and family, follows after --
these relationships ought not to supplant our service to God, but rather
further the kingdom of God as our own personal relationships become a
public testimony of God's grace. I've heard it said before that one of
the best ways to find a wife is simply to keep on doing what God has
called you to do -- and along the way, in God's timing, if it is His
will, He will set before you a corresponding "helpmeet", an &lt;em&gt;ezer
kenegdo&lt;/em&gt;, compatible in ministry. Reading a bit further on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit,
fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the
revelation of Jesus Christ.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=1Pe1:13"&gt;(I Peter 1:13,
NASB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an old adage I heard once from a speaker: "Major on the majors,
and minor on the minors". He was an ex-Mormon, and was sharing about how
to reach Mormons and help them to discern. On the surface, the Mormon
church talks just like any mainline Christian denomination, but when we
dig deeper and ask them important questions -- is Jesus the Son of God,
how can we be saved, etc. -- we find big problems. These are the majors!
Everything else -- the hymns we sing, community service, even living
lives that the world considers "moral" -- those are minor:
not&lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;important, but of &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fear we've lost sight of the majors in church. It saddens me to hear
about people who give up on our church because the hymns are too boring,
or others who give up on coming to prayer meeting because the worship is
too loud, too "free", too "charismatic" (however they define that dicey
term!). Have we lost the discernment of what are the majors and what are
the minors? Have we lost sight of the Great Commission? Have we lost
sight of the many around us who are desperate for the simple message of
the saving grace of Jesus Christ? We are not defined by our style of
music, or our cultural demographic, or our socio-economic class: we are
defined and unified by our life in Jesus Christ and our mission to
preach the gospel to the ends of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard it said before that our church is mostly upper-middle class
professionals: that it's not a church for crack addicts, for instance. I
agree it's good to have a target audience for purposes of
new &lt;em&gt;initiatives&lt;/em&gt;, but are we prepared to &lt;em&gt;respond&lt;/em&gt; to any and all
who enter? To the non-Christian, one church is pretty much the same as
any other -- one of the most common questions I've had non-Christians
ask me is what the difference is between denominations, and why there's
so much animosity. I don't have a good answer for the latter! In a
church of our size and prominence we're pretty much guaranteed already
to have people, many people, addicted to crack, to alcohol, to porn, to
gambling. It's not that they don't exist, it's that they are struggling
silently, because of the certain condemnation and gossip that will
happen if they open up. It is a scathing judgment of our church. Let us
be known as a church for upper-middle class crack addicts! Let us be
known as a church that welcomes alcoholics, smokers of tobacco or
marijuana, those who have had abortions, those who are struggling with
homosexual sin. Church should be a hospital!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those
who are sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I DESIRE
COMPASSION, AND NOT SACRIFICE,' for I did not come to call the
righteous, but sinners.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=Mt9:12-13"&gt;(Matthew
9:12-13)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhh, my heart is rolling now! :) Ach, but I have rambled far from the
current passage, and the thoughts that I had at first today. A book
given to a friend of mine during relationship counseling said something
akin to this: "Stay single in order to &lt;em&gt;serve&lt;/em&gt; Jesus. Get married in
order to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; like Jesus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I totally agree with the word choice, but I see the point:
We who are single have time and freedom to serve God in many ways that
aren't so easy for married couples. At the same time, marriage is the
quintessential picture of God's love relationship with us: the struggles
and lessons learned in marriage need to mould our character to be more
like Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of the fictional character, &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/moonrise-in-my-living-room"&gt;St. John, in *Jane
Eyre*&lt;/a&gt;: he proposed to Jane because
he saw her as a useful tool, a comrade in arms for the ministry. But he
did not love her -- and so he had a wrong concept of marriage. At the
other extreme, I know of many young couples whose lives are so busy that
they simply stop serving God, particularly once they have kids: they
only attend Sunday worship, arrive late, and hide out in the balcony. So
many see church as a subcontracted service they pay for, to babysit
their kids and teach them to be obedient to their parents. But somehow
our service to God ought to be enhanced and refined by family: we
worship and serve God together as a family unit, and the reconciliation
that we pursue within the family spills outward to influence the church
toward unity under Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of my own parent's marriage, how it has become a platform for
ministry to reach many thousands of people all over the world with the
gospel of Jesus Christ. Their marriage is not perfect, to be sure, but
in the honest sharing of lessons learned, all these anecdotes from their
private life (and indeed, ours as well, as their children) become a
public proclamation of God's faithfulness: God's blessing when we follow
His Word, and God's grace when we fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I suppose now you're wondering where I'm going with these thoughts --
if/when am I going to get married! :) I don't really have the answer to
that, myself! It will be in God's timing, by God's calling, and for
God's glory. The breeze is turning colder now; it's time for me to wrap
this up. The word I heard from God &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/acadia-beach-at-low-tide"&gt;this time last year on Acadia
beach&lt;/a&gt; was: &lt;strong&gt;*WAIT*&lt;/strong&gt;. This year,
it seems I'm hearing:&lt;strong&gt;*TRUST*&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

believe the school year is really over today! It's taking me a little
while to transition into summer-mode. So tonight I indulged in a little
leisure reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much of our modern thought process can be traced back to Plato and
Aristotle, but in the past century's postmodernity we have also flown
far from them in many ways. I loved reading about specialization of
roles within the integration inherent in the word &lt;em&gt;techné&lt;/em&gt; (τεχνη:
encompassing skill and craft in arts, science, business, administration,
etc.). But I was also surprised at how many gaping holes in logic there
are in some of Plato's developments, especially in the various ancillary
discussions on justice, government, and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quote which I thought was rather sweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Is not the fairest sight of all," I asked, "for him who has eyes to
see it, the combination in the same bodily form of beauty of
character and looks to match and harmonize with it?""It is indeed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And what is very beautiful will also be very attractive, will it
not?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Certainly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;"It is, then, with people of this sort that the educated man will
fall in love; where the harmony is imperfect, he will not be
attracted."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(Plato, 'Republic', Part III, §1, 402(d))&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aww, isn't that sweet? :) Of course, he then goes on to assert that true
love ought not to have any contact with sex! &lt;em&gt;*sigh*&lt;/em&gt; Plato didn't
read God's design in Genesis about being "one flesh" as husband and
wife. The foolishness of God is still wiser than the wisdom of man!&lt;/p&gt;

lengthy (though interesting) congregational meeting all afternoon. But
why is it that church lately so often drains, stresses, and depresses me
instead of energizing? A walk around this nearby lake in the springtime
sun, some time to think and pray, helps me to recover....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom often says, "Christians should be joyful!" -- not necessarily
giddy-happy, but joyful in the Lord. The speaker last week mentioned how
restaurant workers really do notice the behaviour of Christians when
they go out for lunch after church -- and how so many are sullen,
complaintative, uncommunicative with their kids, condescending to
waitstaff -- and stingy tippers. It's true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been quite cool, though, to chat with the students that are
graduating -- to hear them reflect on their years at Trinity, and to see
where God is taking them next. It's such a privilege to have even a
small part in propelling them forward into the world equipped to use

&lt;p&gt;It's the middle of finals week: I've administered two finals and still
have one left to make, and I'm way behind on my marking, but I just
really needed to get away somewhere quiet. So on my way home, instead of
continuing on Glover Road as usual, I hooked a left turn and headed east
down the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the windows down, sunroof open, and the countryside spread out in
front of me, the calming effect of the open road enveloped me. The
afternoon sunshine, veiled by thin clouds, was bright but not hot,
lighting up the green fields around me. Highway 1 through this portion
of the Fraser Valley is often flat and straight as an arrow, the divided
lanes running like twin monorails through the fertile valley. On both
sides, the valley is walled in with high mountains, still snowcapped in
the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something soothing to me about being on the Trans-Canada
Highway, knowing that it stretches all the way across the continent.
With no agenda, no destination, no deadline, as long as there's gas in
the tank, I could just keep on driving as far as I wanted. No decisions
to make -- I wouldn't even have to decide which exit to take, I could
just go. The life of the lone sojourner, a "voice in the wilderness",
simple and free. Is there a part of me that still yearns for that? Rich

penned these words: "This life has shown me how we're mended / And how
we're torn / How it's O.K. to be lonely / As long as you're free". He
lived a full life but died single, in a tragic car accident in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, though, I had to stop somewhere, and by the time the open
road had blown away my stresses and I relaxed enough to take in my
surroundings, I was past Chilliwack and nearing the famous Harrison Hot
Springs. Finally I exited the highway, switching off the radio, slowing
down, and meandering into Bridal Veil Falls Provincial Park. From the
parking lot, the falls themselves are just a short hike away, a pleasant
stroll through mossy woods, with bark and pine needles soft beneath my
feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridal Falls is a 60-metre misty cascade of white tumbling down round
rock faces, spreading out wider as it drapes down the mountain. The
approach to the falls is up a steep ascent, making it appear even more
tall and grand to the eye. There is also an unexpected breeze: the trail
leading to the falls, through the forest, is protected by surrounding
foliage, so the air is quiet and still. But around the falls, wind
sweeps down the mountainside and follows the water, bringing a cold,
damp mist with it. It is here, beneath the falls, surrounded by the mist
and the roar, that I sit for a spell, sheltered in the lee of a large
cedar tree. I pray, but don't really get any answers, at least as far as
I can tell. I seek clarity, a pathway ahead, guidance in making
decisions. It is unsatisfying to return home without clear answers, but
perhaps it's simply that the message God is speaking is not the kind of
answer I'm attuned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I leave, I hike up a steep, gravelly rockfall, right up to the
foot of the falls. I am inexorably drawn to the beauty and the power of
the falls, the soft innocence of white mist juxtaposed with the ferocity
of the torrent. With the majestic falls above me and the (slightly
dizzying) steep slope below me, I am reminded of God's response to Job's
questions. Job asked, "Why?", and cursed the day of his own birth; his
wife was of little support; his closest friends were quick to assign
blame to him. At first glance it seems as though God did not answer
Job's questions: Job did not immediately get a detailed explanation of
the court in heaven. But God's reply is so much more powerful -- He
points to the stormclouds and the thunder, the Pleiades and the cold
sky, the eagles and the mountain goats, the &lt;em&gt;behemoth&lt;/em&gt; and
the &lt;em&gt;leviathan&lt;/em&gt;. Out of the majesty of creation, the Majestic Creator
demands from Job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Tell Me, if you have understanding.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Who set its measurements? Since you know.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Or who stretched the line on it? On what were its bases sunk?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Or who laid its cornerstone,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When the morning stars sang together,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And all the sons of God shouted for joy?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=job38"&gt;(Job 38:4-7,
NASB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart is rolling now, and together with the young philosopher Elihu,
my response to God's majesty is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;At this also my heart trembles, and leaps from its place.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Listen closely to the thunder of His voice,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And the rumbling that goes out from His mouth.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49&amp;amp;search=job37"&gt;(Job 37:1-2,
NASB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is in control; He is strong and mighty to save. I still don't know
the pathway ahead -- I don't know which exit to take -- but I know this:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.&lt;/p&gt;

Several of the student-led praise teams joined together; there was so
much energy and enthusiasm in the gym! We still have final exams ahead
of us -- stressful times for students and teachers alike -- but praise

group outing to the Chan Centre to hear the UBC Symphony Orchestra. It
was quite good; I liked the Ravel, particularly the prelude. The
Glazunov concerto was an impressively technical showcase for the
saxophone soloist, but I didn't find the piece terribly musically
compelling; maybe I just didn't "get" the message. There was also a
Mendelssohn concerto that was stirring and exciting; a timeless classic.
We also saw Abraham from KS in the violin section! And the son of a
colleague of mine at TWU was playing first cello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason snapped this self-portrait of the two of us by hand: Connie tried
several times to take a photo, but my overly-complicated Treo phone

was carrying a lot alone, and I suppose that's true.&lt;/p&gt;

least to take a walk outside for a bit, so I strolled for five minutes
through our new native plant garden out back behind our building's

"CLUE", up at the lovely sacred retreat centre of &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/rivendell-with-jon-and-elaine"&gt;Rivendell on Bowen
Island&lt;/a&gt;! We all were able to
spend time with each other and spend time in awe of God's faithfulness
and majesty. What struck me most about the weekend was the concept
of &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; -- when we arrived, the hostess quoted a line from the
Fellowship of the Ring: "Time doesn't seem to pass here: it just is."
Throughout most of the retreat, the hands of the clock seemed to
disappear from our consciousnesses; we worried less about &lt;em&gt;chronos&lt;/em&gt;,
and simply moved from one &lt;em&gt;kairos&lt;/em&gt; event to another, together as a
group. What an utterly otherworldly feeling! The final day, of course,
the clock started again, as we frantically hurried to clean up and make
the 12:35 ferry. Oh, and we left a man behind, too! He did make it back
later, under his own power!&lt;/p&gt;

It's been a
long winter and a long semester. I thank God for giving me little
reminders to slow down, to "do" less activity and "be" more of Christ's
character -- to talk less and listen more, to be grateful and joyful for
God's providence, and to let go of worry. Last week, one of my students
popped by my office hours just to encourage me and thank me for doing
devotions every day in class. Then he added, "I hope you're able to take
a real Sabbath rest this weekend; it looks like you need it." It's true;
I really needed to block out time to rest with God and be grateful for
what He's given. A couple weeks ago, a church friend with whom I hadn't
chatted for several months gave me a firm reminder and exhortation just
to let go, to enjoy the community at church and not to try to fix all
the problems. Our &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/rivendell-with-jon-and-elaine"&gt;visit to
Rivendell&lt;/a&gt; last week was a good
reminder, too, of how I need regularly to rest in God's presence, not
worrying about my life or future, but just trusting that God will lead
the way one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes end early for me on Fridays, so after praise chapel today I took
my regular trip south of the border to fetch mail and gas up. It's
always a nice feeling being back in the States -- although I suppose
it's purely psychological! The drive out to Aldergrove and then to
Lynden is so beautiful and relaxing. People ask me about the long
commute I have to church, and I tell them that I actually enjoy driving!
(It's just the traffic that's not so pleasant! :) ) Even when I'm stuck
in traffic, it's a strangely liberating feeling to know that I can't do
anything about it -- I've done my responsibility, and the rest is out of
my hands -- so I might as well enjoy the time. I can always crank
up &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://praise1065.com/"&gt;Praise 106.5 FM&lt;/a&gt;, or the MP3 player,
and worship God in music and prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I'm typing this, I've just finished my late lunch in Lynden, at the
lovely Sidewalk Cafe. The shops are lined up in a tidy little replica of
a Dutch street, complete with canal, footbridges, streetlights, and park
benches -- all indoors! Rather handy considering all the rainy weather
we get around here. As I was walking in, I saw a young father in his
early 30s holding his crying daughter, about 6 years old, in his lap.
She was rather upset about something (I later overheard that it was
because she was unable to wear her new flowery dress for today) and
wasn't too happy with her daddy, but yet was still clinging around his
neck, as he reasoned softly with her and held her gently. I have to
confess that seeing this made me a little teary-eyed; it was such a
touching scene. I thought of saying something to him just to encourage
him that he was being a good dad, but in the end I chickened out. His
tenderness reminded me that even when we are upset or downtrodden in
life, even when we are mad &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; God, our Heavenly Father still holds
us tight in his arms, gently speaking words of Truth, alluring us back
with His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for Him;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Because of the man who carries out wicked schemes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Cease from anger and forsake wrath;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Do not fret; it leads only to evildoing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;-- Psalm 37:7-8&lt;/div&gt;

weekend, and he's asked me to help out a bit, so the three of us went to
scout it out today. It's only 20mins away by ferry, yet so far from the
stress and traffic. The Rivendell retreat centre is space to breathe, a
place to silence the cacophony and tune our hearts to hear the still
small voice of the Lord. The encircling mountains, lush green valleys,
cloud and water, are all so wistfully breathtaking -- but then I
remembered that the tabernacle of the Lord is in my heart, in humility,
and obedience, and quietness before Him, wherever I am, whether here in
Rivendell, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/worship-service-in-the-garage"&gt;in my garage&lt;/a&gt;,

with the rain streaming down the windshield:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I look to the church for encouragement and hope, I only get
frustration and disappointment. If I look to my friends, I only get
sympathy. If I look to myself, I only get futility and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I lift my eyes up to the loving Saviour Jesus Christ, I behold
perfection and beauty. I am comforted in the knowledge that He holds us
all in the palm of His hand -- the church, my friends and relationships,
and even my very heart. I must trust that He knows what He's doing, and
that He will accomplish His plan in His perfect timing. If I take
matters into my own hands, I fall into the same trap of Abraham with
Hagar, or Moses with the Egyptian.&lt;/p&gt;

the student-led worship teams are so enthusiastic in leading hundreds of

own chapel twice weekly, but in my two years here at TWU, I hadn't made
the trek across campus to visit -- until now! Today's ACTS chapel was
special: the CanIL students, led by Daryn, led a wonderful time of
worship, complete with singing, string quartet, and choir anthems. The
atmosphere is so much more intimate, only about 40 people; it was so
refreshing! It was also very cool to chat afterward with all the friends
there from church -- Esther, Jon, Daryn, and Sally. I enjoyed hearing
Sally share about her+Tom's calling to missions. My observation agrees
with hers that the bureaucracy so often quenches rather than encourages
those with a heart to serve. But with or without denominational support,
if God calls, we must go!&lt;/p&gt;

Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre", which I &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/an-afternoon-with-richard"&gt;picked up not long
ago&lt;/a&gt;. I quite like it! The effusive
descriptions of landscape and character are so immersive, and I love the
Romantic picture of external weather reflecting internal emotions. The
character of St. John also really made me think -- he's a very driven,
self-disciplined, noble servant of God, but he sacrificed his own love
towards Rosamund because of his sense of duty and calling. I wonder how
effective he'd be preaching the gospel and communicating God's love when
he had denied his own heart in this way....&lt;/p&gt;

faithful to the Scripture but also hit very practical applications for
the congregation of mostly teens and parents. It's a funny story about
Josh: when we were both new and checking out churches, we both visited
ECBC at the same time, then coincidentally FL also! Then for a few weeks
he was at Port Moody PGMB, which I had visited earlier, too. He's
settled at Burnaby PGC for over a year now, and is transferring
membership. It's a good thing; God can use him powerfully to build up
spiritual maturity and instill a biblical mentality in the young adults
here. Over sushi lunch, we had a great time catching up and discussing
church vision; we have different perspectives -- he from humanities, I
from sciences -- but a common goal in Christ!&lt;/p&gt;

it a few days of brilliant blue skies, a welcome respite from our
relentlessly long winter of rain, wind, and snow. This is the front door
of my building, which houses all the science departments, ranging from
math/computers/physics to biology, chemistry, environmental science, and
nursing. My office is in the back down in the basement, but I still get
a nice window view of the blue sky.&lt;/p&gt;

It always amazes me
how quickly church empties after worship service and Sunday School --
within half an hour the foyer at KS is pretty much empty, save for those
who have meetings or other responsibilities. What ever happened to
church as a family, being deliberately un-busy for each other, spending
time together even when we don't "have" to? Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figured, hey, I'm free to explore around town a bit on my own for
lunch! This time I didn't go quite as far as &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/ferry-at-horseshoe-bay"&gt;Horseshoe
Bay&lt;/a&gt;, just around UBC and back into the
Kitsilano area. After lunch, while strolling down Broadway, I noticed
this cute little bookshop, and something inside me nudged me to go in.
It's been probably a dozen years since I've set foot in a real
mom-and-pop bookstore, not a mega Borders or Barnes&amp;amp;Noble. It was so
quiet inside, and I spent about ten minutes browsing through their
classics shelf before I heard the word "Gnostic" from behind a few
shelves away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man's voice was asking the shopkeeper, "Do you know anything about
these Gnostics?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nah, I ... I really don't know much about them", replied the young
college girl, as she continued filing away books. I started to wonder if
God had had a reason for me to visit this particular bookshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man persisted, "I'm really wondering what they're about: if what
these Gnostics are saying is true, then that really changes everything
about Christianity!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an internal struggle -- should I strike up a conversation? Listen
more? Quietly walk out? Maybe he would just drop the subject, and then I
could continue browsing in peace without the guilt of having "shirked my
duty" -- after all, we shouldn't be judgmental or confrontational,
right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So you don't know anything about Gnosticism? 'Cause man, if these guys
are right, ..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My curiousity finally overcame me. Slowly coming around the bookshelf, I
saw the inquirer: a thin, gangly man in his upper forties, with short,
scruffy grey facial hair, sitting on a chair with his legs tucked under
him like a teenager. He exhibited that geeky, quirky chic of someone
who's lived alone with his own rules for many years. I made eye contact,
then slowly started describing the Gnostic religion and its unique
beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got to the mystic &lt;em&gt;gnosis&lt;/em&gt; and the Archons, I could tell he was
getting really confused -- and that's when I finally noticed the
paperback in his hands: "The Gnostic Gospels". Ah, that really has
nothing to do with the Gnostics ... and more to do with "The DaVinci
Code". I gave a bit of background on the Gnostic 'gospels' and how very
different they are from canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fired back, "But Jesus claimed his was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way -- what a
power grab! And, '&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; are my chosen disciples' -- how convenient for
them, so they can setup this hierarchy!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, religion over the centuries has often misused Scripture in order to
position human leaders as intermediaries between people and God -- but
Jesus came to abolish that and give us direct access to God, through
himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But Jesus is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way? Uh-uh! OK, maybe I'll grant that Jesus
was sent from God, but I'll&lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; accept that he's the only way!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the next hour in deep discussion: me leaning against a
bookshelf, a paperback in hand; him on the chair, constantly shifting
positions, half getting up, now pulling his legs under him, now bouncing
his knee -- evidently incredulous and deeply disturbed by my responses
and by the claims of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked me, "How can you believe in a Creator? Don't you believe in
evolution, ape-man, and all that?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I launched into an explanation of the second law of thermodynamics,
information theory, and creation as originally "very good". I was
part-way through describing Java Man when he stopped me mid-sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hold on here, let me just ask you this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Are you for real?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:) Heh, I had to laugh a bit at that -- yes, I'm very much for real!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So you believe in Adam and Eve?!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes sir, I do. Consider just one aspect, population -- before the advent
of antibiotics, the world population was doubling about every 125-150
years. Even with occasional epidemics like the bubonic plague,
extrapolating back from our current population of 6 billion, we get to
two people in just a few thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;"Adam and Eve!?" He got up, all the way this time, and turned away
from me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;"But they're just fairy tales! This is the new millenium, man! You're
educated; even if I weren't educated, I still wouldn't believe in
them!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gently reminded him of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: "When you have
eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be
the truth". But he was overcome with incredulity, and finally walked out
to leave the bookshop. I momentarily regretted not having asked his
name, so that I could continue to pray for him, but just as he opened
the door, by God's providence, another store employee called after him,
"Take care, Richard!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an energizing and joyful experience to have the chance to talk with
a random stranger about Jesus! Thank you, Lord, for this divine
appointment: for bringing me to Kitsilano, to this bookshop, and to this
man Richard. I may never get another chance to see him on this earth,
but may Your Word and Your love strike his heart powerfully: disturb
him, shake him, until he finds that there is no peace without Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Postscript:)&lt;/em&gt; I had stayed quite long in the little bookshop, so it
was only reasonable that I purchase the paperback I'd been holding.
While ringing me up, the college girl laughed, "So after all that, the
book you're getting is 'Jane Eyre'?" :) OK, that and Plato's "Republic".
"That's more like it!"&lt;/p&gt;

about time management with the kids, and it was so much fun to hang out
with these dozen or so wonderful, energetic, hilarious, surprising,
insightful kids! Once again I underestimated how bright and intelligent
the kids are; I must apologize! Since nearly half the kids were fairly
new and didn't usually attend the small group, I figured that we'd need
a few songs and games to break the ice a bit. But I think the ice had
already been smashed to smithereens by the time the kids were bouncing
off the walls! :) They got much more engaged and focused once we got
into the "meat" of things when I explained &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;&amp;amp;search=1Cor9:23-27"&gt;I Corinthians
9:23-27&lt;/a&gt;
-- living with purpose and making the most of our short time on earth.
They totally surprised me with their terrific and very deep questions:
is Jesus the only way, what about other religions? What about people
who've never done anything bad but just don't believe in Jesus? What
about First Nations people or other groups that might never have heard
about Jesus? Is there an "unforgivable sin", and what does that mean? So
much excitement and interest and wonderful questions -- we ran longer
than the parents in the next room! I should have gotten into the
Scripture earlier and left more time for questions; sorry guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, during the snacks, I stayed even longer to chat and have some
informal Q&amp;amp;A time with the parents -- and that was quite rewarding, too,
to see these parents who care so much about their kids, and not just
about their marks in school or what instruments they played, but about
their happiness, emotional growth, and spiritual status. Many of them
observed that their kids are so mind-numbingly bored in school, they end
up becoming trouble-makers -- yep, I was like that, too! But I am happy
to see these parents taking responsibility for their own kids' education
rather than leaving it in the hands of the schools. They are all good
kids -- bright and talented and compassionate and analytical and
expressive! The prayer, and the task, is to channel their interests into
serving others to bring glory to God who created us and loves us. It's
an interesting feeling now that I'm closer in age to the parents than I
am to the kids; I really empathize with their heartache and the
emotional ups and downs that come with parenthood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This grab-shot was taken during the snack time, an impromptu performance
by our ten-year-old virtuoso violinist, Lucy! She's super-cute and so
energetic! :) She played some Vivaldi, and here she's playing an
Oriental-sounding piece unfamiliar to me; it was highly technical, with
lots of tricky intervals and slides. She's a real child prodigy, and
more importantly, she's using her gifts to glorify God!&lt;/p&gt;

its thing, I went for a nice stroll through downtown Seattle. Something
about the city, the people, the traffic, the pace of life, makes me walk
faster, even if I don't have anywhere to go, like today. Head up, be
aware of your surroundings, look like you have a destination, be relaxed
but ready for anything -- "condition yellow", I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting here alone at a small park next to the aquarium, I pause and
take in the beautiful coloured glass-steel-stone highrises (there's the
1201 3rd building again!), the low roar of the Alaskan Way Viaduct (the
black double-decker freeway across the middle), the chill in the air,
and the salt sea smell of Elliott Bay. Watching a group of joggers go by
reminds me of what it's like to live in the city: to work and play and
love and struggle, all within the microcosm and forced confluence of
people that is the city. I realize that it really has been a long time:
I've grown used to the slower pace of life and relaxed, trusting
environment in a smaller town. I feel similarly about downtown
Vancouver, and I also feel similarly about NYC: it's exciting and
international and I love to visit, but I don't think I could sustain
living there for an extended time. Maybe I'm a small-town boy at heart,
or maybe I'm just mellowing with age.... :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I moved two years ago, numerous people (both Canadians and
Americans!) have asked me why I'm here -- why would an American choose
to live in Canada? Why move back to a big city? Why move to a city where
I have no relatives, no established network, and all my friends are new
within the last two years? Am I here to make money? (nope) To run away
from something? (nada) To find a life mate? (perhaps) I'm still not
totally sure why I'm here, but I know that I have been drawn back
inexplicably to the Pacific NW for a reason, and, I trust, in God's
Providence. Seattle will always be my hometown, but Vancouver is like a
sister city, with a character of its own, and I've had high hopes for
the Chinese Christian community there. Who knows but I might end up
moving back to Western Washington sometime in the future to raise a
family (ha, like I could afford to buy a house in greater Seattle!). But
for right now I'm settled where God has placed me, and Vancouver has
grown dear to my heart. Not, I suppose, because of any innate merit of
its own, not because I had a list of criteria and it satisfied all of
them, but simply by choice. I'm here, I've developed relationships, I've
grown fond -- just because I &lt;strong&gt;*chose*&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, in a way it's similar to why I'm at my church. People ask me, "what
made you choose VCAC?", as though I had been ranking the churches I've
visited, and somehow VCAC came out on top. But the very reason why I was
visiting different churches (and why I continue to network with them)
is &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it is nonsensical to rate or compare them -- they each
have their own network of unsaved people they can reach, and there's no
point in comparing churches. As long as we're sticking to the Word of
God and proclaiming the gospel, we're all on the same team, here. We're
not&lt;em&gt;competitors&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;collaborators&lt;/em&gt;. The idea of "ranking"
churches only buys into the consumer mentality that so many ABC/CBC
young adults have towards church. I didn't have a list of criteria, and
there is no one "best" church: I simply made a choice, and I'm sticking
with it, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small white pebble that I carry around in my inner coat
pocket; I picked it up &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/semiahmoo-beach-and-drayton-harbor"&gt;on Semiahmoo
beach&lt;/a&gt; last summer. It's
not a supertitious "magic crystal" or anything, but I carry it with me
and fidget with it every now and again, and it reminds me of that prayer
time I had when I was walking on that beach. There's absolutely nothing
special about this pebble in and of itself, but it carries special
significance for me, simply because I chose it -- I impart significance
to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago when I had opportunity to teach a high-school girls'
Sunday school class, I gave each one of them a small white bougainvillea
blossom for Easter. One girl's flower fell apart, and I figured it's no
big deal; there are plenty more on the bushes just outside. But she
replied, "no, it's not the same; this one was given by you". I think our
Heavenly Father looks at us the same way: we have value, beauty, and
significance, not because of any skill or achievement in ourselves, but
because we are chosen by the King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved
us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His
mercy.(Titus 3:4-5a, NIV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ministry at church. My thoughts are still formulating and aren't set in
stone yet, just some ponderings. Oh, and the photo is just a random
one &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://photo.seanho.com/2003-03_Arboretum/"&gt;from an old
album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi , thanks for thinking of me. This email will be a very long
answer to a very short question. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I do enjoy worshipping God and am thankful for every
opportunity to lead worship. I am always happy to help. And I don't
want to discourage you or anyone else from serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I personally am somewhat wary of "applying", volunteering
for something (particularly a leadership position) that nobody has
asked me to do. It puts the incumbent ministry leadership in the
awkward position of evaluating ("auditioning") me to see whether I'm
qualified for leadership, whether my motives are pure, and it puts
me in the awkward position of having to "prove" myself to them.
Having been on both sides of that table, I can say that neither
position is comfortable. And I am really tired of having my motives
questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has worked in the past for me, and continues to work well for
me, is to make myself available for invitations. I am always happy
to help in any ministry in any capacity, when asked. If nobody asks
me, that's quite all right -- I don't need to be in leadership here,
and there are plenty of other ways to serve God, with or without
"official" sanction by the church. It is a very different definition
of a "servant's heart" from what we see in many parts of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My philosophy of church ministry is that if I am in a position of
leadership in a ministry, then God is revealing His vision for this
ministry to me, so I am self-motivated to share this vision, and I
proactively "head-hunt" --&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go into the pools of potential helpers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get to know people and their giftings,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;share the vision with them, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individually ask if they would prayerfully consider joining our
team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with the vision initiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In asking people individually, I am indicating that I know and trust
them, and I am implicitly committing to mentor/train them, sharing
in the responsibility. If they mess up, if they feel underqualified,
if people question their motives or spiritual maturity, I will stand
in their corner and defend them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've also found is that people respond really well to this
approach! Saying, "I know you, I trust you, would you consider
joining us?" works so much better than posting a sign-up sheet in
the foyer, then sitting back and complaining that nobody signs up,
or guilt-tripping people into helping. But it does take effort to
proactively get to know people, and so often when we are in
leadership we spend so much time &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things, and we don't
allocate time for &lt;em&gt;relating&lt;/em&gt; to people, especially to those
outside of our ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a great time together, and they are just so welcoming! It's so
refreshing to be greeted with, "I'm glad to see you!", rather than,
"What are you doing here?". They invited my mom and I to their Chinese

Last Sunday one of our dear family friends, Mrs. Elsie Law, flew away to
her Saviour's side. She had been a faithful servant of Christ, devoted
pastor's wife, longsuffering widowed mother of two, a pillar of the
church, and a part of our family for many many years, going back to when
she was a youth counselor and Sunday School teacher for my parents when
they were kids. She was wise, calm, confident, opinionated -- and more
than a little mischievous! My last memory of her is just last year when
I went to visit Seattle: I was kind of lamenting the high expectations
my parents have on a future wife for me, and she patted my hand and
said, "Well, you just tell them that you're the one getting married, not
them, and it's your decision!" Wow, I hadn't expected that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad was asked to share some remembrances on behalf of all her
friends, but he's away in the mainland right now in his ministries, so
my mom shared, and I translated from Mandarin into English. I snuck in
this photo while Elder Hu made some closing statements; there were
probably over 700 people there, but you can't see them from this point
of view from our front-row seats. It was refreshing and comforting to be
back in the company of the church I grew up in, but our time was short
to catch up with old friends, and our conversations were subdued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerably fewer people came to the short graveside service afterward,
but I thought it was beautiful. The weather was just perfect, I thought,
for a funeral -- patches of sun and cloud, windy, with a bit of chill in
the air, the trees bare but the grass still green, and the leaves
blowing around us on the open hillside. Not a day for much laughter or
joking, but a very good day, a day for reflection and thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

wonderful kids, both old friends and new friends! On Friday night I had
the privilege to share with the very bright and genuine youth of
Surrey &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecbc.org/"&gt;ECBC&lt;/a&gt;'s True Love fellowship. I could
hardly believe their attention spans as they listened to a boring old
professor talk about science and the Bible for nearly an hour and a
half! I was so impressed with their engaging, insightful questions and
passionate desire to share the gospel with their classmates. Thanks to
Jason for extending the invitation and for working so faithfully with
the kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's photo is from this afternoon's service with the precious kids
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ccgc-canada.org/powerteen/"&gt;the PowerTeens youth group&lt;/a&gt;
at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ccgc-canada.org/"&gt;CCGC&lt;/a&gt; Richmond. Here Xiao-yi is
getting all tangled up in our "human knot" icebreaker game. There were a
lot of newcomers, especially at the Richmond church! The kids at both
Burnaby and Richmond congregations have grown since &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2005/ccgchurch-in-burnaby"&gt;last I was
here&lt;/a&gt;, and it was so heartwarming just to
see their adorable smiling faces! The &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/ccgc-youth-tent-camping"&gt;tent camping trip last
summer&lt;/a&gt; was an especially precious
time building relationships with these kids. I'll get to see them again
next week!&lt;/p&gt;

Vancouver and was immediately impressed with his passionate and simple
presentation of God's Word. His lovely, impassioned, Scottish accent
helps, too! What I really appreciate is that his outlines are taken
straight from the outline of Scripture. Today, Dr. Milne's two points
are taken from Paul's two responses to God's calling on the road to
Damascus: "Who are you, Lord?", and "What shall I do, Lord?" &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ac22:6-10;&amp;amp;version=31"&gt;(Acts
22:6-10)&lt;/a&gt;.
We first need to know (1) &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; we belong to, we need to know the heart
of God, before we can know (2) &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; we will do for Him. A simple,
clear two-point outline taken straight from the Bible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beef I have with structured devotionals like Rick Warren's
famous &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.purposedriven.com/"&gt;"40 Days of Purpose"&lt;/a&gt;, or
even the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cmalliance.ca/visionprayerc611.php"&gt;C&amp;amp;MA "Vision
prayer"&lt;/a&gt; that we used
recently in a prayer meeting. I don't disagree with any individual
point, but the outline appears to be out of someone's head --
and &lt;em&gt;outline is content, too&lt;/em&gt;. Why these 40 points? Why this order? Is
this exhaustive? Are some more important than others? Can they be
categorized hierarchically? Someone else could come up with a different
set of 40 points. The feeling I get is that the author first came up
with an outline, then thought, "hmm, what verses can I find to back up
my points?". That's a slippery slope! We need to read the Bible on its
own terms, without our own preconceived agenda, and mold our worldview
to fit it, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, off the soapbox again....&lt;/p&gt;

conference at Canada Place, with dozens of plenary speakers and
seminars, and hundreds of exhibitor booths. It's free admission (for
most things), so there are thousands of people; most of the seminars are
full way before they start. I ran into a ton of TWU people, several VCAC
people, and a few friends from other area churches. There were so many
exhibitor booths, just walking once through took me a couple hours! It
was nice gettting an overview of the local, national, and international
ministries represented. I realized that, although there are a few
international ministries, the networks in Canada are to a large extent
still separate from the U.S. ones that I'm familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don't like large crowds, so I spent quite a bit of time
outside on the Canada Place pier, bundled up in the chill air, enjoying
the views of the water, the mountains behind North Vancouver, and the
crystal blue sky. The word "calling" comes up everywhere in a conference
like this, and I think that's really the purpose of MissionsFest -- to
inspire, encourage, and equip people in the calling God has for each one
of us. While wandering through the exhibitor booths, a friend asked me,
"Have you found what you're looking for yet?" I think she was just
referring to the booths, but upon reflection, it seems the question is
apropos to the larger issue of &lt;em&gt;calling&lt;/em&gt; -- have you found your
calling, the direction in which God is leading you? It's a question that
pretty much everybody faces, particularly in the young-adult years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, though, the question was answered long ago: I know
without a doubt that the calling God has had on my life, from before I
was born, is after the spirit of John the Baptist, after whom I was
named. I have been reluctant to follow, because it could be a rather
lonely path. Those who don't know me well will immediately scoff and
question and try to fit me into a more "acceptable" ministry. But as I
sat on a park bench on this pier and reread Luke chapters 1-3, the
mission of John the Baptist resonated so powerfully it brought me to
tears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their
God. It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit
and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE
CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so
as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk1:13-17&amp;amp;version=49"&gt;(Luke 1:16-17,
NASB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly what I desire to do more than anything else: to prepare
the way for Jesus, to turn the hearts of the fathers back to the
children, and the hearts of the children back to the fathers &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mal4;&amp;amp;version=49"&gt;(Malachi
4:6, the last verse of the Old
Testament)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the timing and the preparation are in God's hands, and I think
patience is what He's teaching me now. I've been so impatient to become
a part of this church, but I'm starting to realize that I might never
become fully accepted/trusted here, and perhaps I just need to accept
that I might always remain an outsider, an iconoclast, a voice in the
wilderness. I wonder what John the Baptist did during all those years in
the wilderness before the word of the Lord came to him. But then I
remember that when his ministry did start, it made a powerful impact for
a few short years, like Jesus' own earthly ministry -- all in God's
timing. It seems I've forgotten already that simple one-word lesson
from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps27;&amp;amp;version=49"&gt;Psalm
27:14&lt;/a&gt;,
that God reminded me of &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/acadia-beach-at-low-tide"&gt;less than a year
ago&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;*WAIT*&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, John the Baptist never got married (as far as we know), and
that would really suck. Then there's the whole thing with getting
beheaded in his early thirties; yeah, here's hoping that part doesn't
apply, either!&lt;/p&gt;

been quite encouraging and hopeful at church! This morning's message by
Dr. George Durance at our lay leaders' "retreat" emphasized the
importance of &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; as a spiritual discipline -- and how hard it is
to do when our churches' culture is so often focused on "DO" rather than
"BE". Dr. Durance mentioned seven different ways in which people of
different personalities can rest. Two of the ones I remembered are
"relational rest" and "contemplative rest". After the seminar a bunch of
LIGHT folks (and a couple of us non-LIGHT young adults) went out for
sushi and had rather enjoyable conversations on everything from
euthanasia to Ginny's cat-that-wasn't-her-cat. I found it to be
wonderful "relational rest" for a Saturday afternoon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With three hours left to kill before my dinner appointment, I took a
stroll around Station Square until I found myself here on a lonely park
bench nearby the Burnaby Public Library. In quiet contemplative rest I
simply sat and watched these cute little Mandarin-speaking kids play in
the snow. One five-year-old boy was just walking around eating random
chunks of snow! So cute... I also had an encouraging chat with a random
brother in Christ who stopped by, Lowell from Willingdon church. Lowell
had felt a calling to evangelism a year ago, and has been approaching
random strangers to share the gospel with them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chill of the slanting winter sun, as I prayed, my heart was
quieted by the knowledge of God's love. My prayer once again to God is
that He prepare and equip me to be the very most Godly and devoted
husband and father that I can be, according to His calling and His
incomparable power working within me.&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, in the grand scheme of things it's not a lot of snow, but I really
really need to get snow tires now; my worn all-seasons are like glass on
this wet powder. I wonder how many more storms we'll get this season. I
was so thankful for our ever-humble custodians, Alan+Phyllis, who
shepherded me home, following behind me to make sure I didn't get stuck.
Their kindness reminded me of 1Cor1:4 -- "Love is kind". χρηστευομαι

the Seattle area; I'm still thinking of bringing a cutting back. But
getting successful cuttings from gardenias is very tricky, so I figured
I'd get a gardenia up here to try my hand first. Of course, this one
(Vetchii) has been in greenhouse conditions, so it came with nearly a
dozen buds. I fully expected most of them to drop off with the shock of
being in a different environment, but so far none have fallen, and here

shop -- get in, get the goods, and get out? Yeah, I fit that stereotype
perfectly, especially when it comes to shopping for linens and clothes.
But I really did need new bedsheets, so off I went to WillowBrook mall
on the last day of Boxing Week. Ten minutes later, here I am, mission
accomplished, ready to go home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered I've been wanting a nice long winter overcoat, warmer
than my windbreaker and nicer than my big parka. So I walked around the
mall, visiting every men's clothing store and trying on coats, and
actually just ... &lt;em&gt;shopping&lt;/em&gt;. What an odd experience! I spent two
hours there; I was quite proud of myself. The women reading this are
probably rolling their eyes right now, but have patience with me -- I'm
not good at this! I often like to see the whole range first, then pick
the best from what's available. So I poked through the Bay's selection,
then went to a specialty store and tried this really soft 15/85
cashmere/wool formal topcoat. The fabric was so nice, and it was on
sale, too -- for only $695! yipes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I went next door and bought a fairly standard London Fog
lined trenchcoat for $50. I'm quite happy with it; I'm content!&lt;/p&gt;

it in the car on the way to elementary school. The music is stirring and
syncopated; beautiful and so characteristically Russian. Today I
attended a matinee showing at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/theatres/qet/qet.html"&gt;the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in
Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;,
presented by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.balletbc.com/"&gt;Ballet BC&lt;/a&gt; and the Alberta
Ballet, together with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vancouversymphony.ca/"&gt;VSO&lt;/a&gt;.
Every time I listen through the entire ballet, I feel like the famous
parts are all so short and crowded in the second act. The first act is
mostly narrative; it's the ethereal fantasy of the second act that gets
the imagination going. But the second act finishes so quickly; I want
each segment to be at least twice as long!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to compare how different choreographers interpret the
classic story. The last time I saw &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pnb.org/"&gt;the Pacific NW
Ballet&lt;/a&gt; perform &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnb.org/season/nutcracker/"&gt;the
Nutcracker&lt;/a&gt; was about ten
years ago; I'd like to go back again to see Maurice Sendak's fantastical
artwork and set design. In North Carolina, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carolinaballet.com/"&gt;Carolina Ballet
production&lt;/a&gt; was quite kid-friendly:
the dancers did a good job, particularly in the first act, of playfully
and whimsically involving the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the production here in Vancouver; I thought the choice of having
the entire second act happen in the royal court simplified set design
somewhat. I've seen other interpretations where each dance (Spaniards,
Arabians, Chinese, etc.) is set in a different location, and the swan
boat flies Clara and the Nutcracker Prince to each place. I have to say,
though, I really disagree with their interpretation of the Arabian
dance: there was just far too much activity and flailing around. The
Arabians are supposed to be seductive and enchanting, with slow and
deliberate, meaningful movements -- that's what the music is saying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was quite enjoyable, and I would see it again next year.
The Queen Elizabeth Theatre is a terrific venue with wonderful
sightlines -- I arrived late and was seated in the way back of the
mezzanine for the first act, but even back in the "cheap seats" the view
was great, and if anything the rustling of seats and papers was a little
more muffled in the mezzanine than it was in the balcony. I sat in my
original seat for the second act; it was in the "nicer" part of the
balcony, and I even saw Canadian actors Michael+Susan Hogan and their
kids, seated just in front of me in the dress circle (Mr. Hogan
plays &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/cast/tigh/"&gt;Colonel Saul
Tigh&lt;/a&gt; on the new
"Battlestar Galactica", among other roles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's rare that I make the trip out to downtown Vancouver, so as I drove
home, I was struck again by the sharp contrast between the glossy,
expensive high-rise condos and the very destitute people on E. Hastings.
At a stop light by a senior's centre on the Upper East Side, I could see
despair in the eyes of the people inside, mostly Asians. I wonder if we
could bring the church kids there, to bring a little light and song and
the gospel of Jesus Christ to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I never thought "seasonal affective disorder" would affect me -- I
always liked the gentle drizzle and soft grey light that we get here in
the Pacific NW -- but this past week I've been cooped up indoors and
kinda bummed out a bit. So when I saw some golden sunlight and brilliant
blue skies today, I set my mind to go out and enjoy it! There are so
many photo opportunities right here around Langley, so I didn't need to
go far, just up to nearby Fort Langley on the banks of the Fraser River.
Up a small bluff I found this quiet horse farm; everything here was so
still and peaceful. Now if only those horses would pause to lift their
heads for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer meeting tonight was quite surprising, in a good way. The theme
was "thanksgiving sharing", and since we only had about 15 people,
everyone around the circle got about 5 minutes to share what they're
thankful to God for from 2006, and to pray. It was amazing: every one of
us shared some very personal and honest testimonies, struggles that God
has brought us through this year. No Sunday façades here! I was so happy
to see that! It seems like prayer meeting is finally starting to become
its own open community/fellowship, rather than yet another spectacle for
people to drop in on anonymously. One of our popular Willow-Creek
catchphrases is "authenticity", and we often equate it with small
groups. But I think tonight was a good illustration that authenticity
can and ought to extend beyond the small group!&lt;/p&gt;

including a couple huge kettle drums (at right), and a children's choir
(in a row up front) with a cool set of handbells. It was pretty cool,
each contingent (choir, orchestra, handbell choir) had their own
conductor, and Abraham was the master conductor orchestrating everything

contemporary, and also loud. We had time for one more song, which
everyone expected to also be contemporary, but what came out was the

our group was brought back to the timeless truth and childlike faith of

Yeah, so with the sudden 15cm of snow we
got overnight last weekend, I learned quickly that snow and bald
all-season tires are not a good mix. So, by gracefully sliding into a
curb at Costco, real low speed, less than 20kph, I mangled my front
driver-side axle, steering knuckle, hub, control arm, bushings, lower
tie bar, rear beam and rear rotor -- the dealership quoted me $1700 in
parts, plus four hours of labour! Yipes! The car's still in the shop,
waiting on parts, so this weekend I've got this lovely rental, a 2007
Toyota Camry. The interior of the Camry is nice and big, with a luxury
feel, but it wallows like a boat in the corners and is horribly
underpowered with the 2.5L engine. It's got a tighter turning radius
than my little Sentra, though!&lt;/p&gt;

church in Vancouver today, but gave up on that idea... then we thought
of walking to the small neighbourhood church that meets at the middle
school across the street, but eventually gave up on that, too! So my mom
and I stayed at home and prayed together; we watched the Crystal
Cathedral's "Hour of Power" on TV (not too pleased with Robert
Schuller's "prosperity gospel": the sermon was rather disappointing,
mostly asking for money) and a Radio Bible Class program on Saul
(walking through various Holy Land sites; that was pretty cool!).

makes everything so quiet and peaceful and bright!&lt;/p&gt;

the Vancouver Academy of Music put on a terrific premiere concert as the
Vanier Trio -- piano, violin, cello. The VAM is right across the Burrard
Inlet from downtown Vancouver, in the waterfront Vanier Park, right next
to the planetarium. The Koerner Recital Hall is an intimate environment,
seating only 289 in a long narrow arrangement, a perfect setting for a
small recital intended for VAM students, family, and friends. I liked
how the faculty explained a bit of the backstory behind each piece
before performing it. The largo movement of Beethoven's "Ghost" trio was
probably my favourite!&lt;/p&gt;

could do it! So peculiar....&lt;/p&gt;

Christian education is, especially for the impressionable primary-school
years!&lt;/p&gt;

know why. This morning at church I sat in on the Mandarin service: it
was very encouraging, and the sermon was great, too. Afterward there was
a lunch at church, but I wasn't quite sure if I ought to go to that, and
I don't really like big crowds anyway. So I ended up having a relaxing
solo lunch at a quiet little pub on Clark and Kingsway; that was nice.
In the afternoon I popped in on the study room at KS to take a look, and
ended up helping a couple students with their calculus and geography.
That was pretty relaxing, too -- as long as I deliberately forgot about
my own lengthy to-do list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church is still just a bit frustrating for me. I'm looking for people I
can cowork with, people who are serving because they really enjoy it,
not because of obligation or misplaced "commitment", and who want to
share that vision and ministry with others -- it's not "my" ministry,
but God's ministry. So far I've found a few people who do their jobs
very well, and whom I admire, but it's been really slow going to see if
they'll actually let me in to cowork with them. Maybe it just takes
time. It would be easy for me to strike out on my own, to initiate my
own ministry with my own vision and plan -- and who knows, that may yet
happen in the future -- but I also know that I can't be a "lone ranger",
that teamwork is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, the group that I've found so far that best exhibits the
positive attitude towards ministry I'm looking for is the Mandarin
congregation. It's just the right size, there is a genuine family
atmosphere across all ages, and they really know how to welcome people
and train up disciples at all stages of the Christian walk. They choose
to look at the potential in people, rather than the deficiencies. The
result is vibrancy, warmth, and spiritual growth. Just today, in the
sermon, Pastor Alfred made a joking reference to Frank, and (1) everyone
knew who Frank was, and (2) everyone knew Frank well enough to get the
joke, even those who hadn't been coming for long. I think that says a
lot about the relational atmosphere! I wish we in English service could
learn from them -- I know the numbers make it difficult, but I also
think a lot of people see the backs of 400 heads and don't even try to
step out of their insular group, instead putting up walls in the name of
"building authentic relationships". I've said before, authenticity is
not predicated on exclusivity. We as mature Christians ought to be able
to be authentic with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, this is turning into a polemic; I'll get off my soapbox now. I have
to learn to be less of a trouble-maker and boat-rocker like my dad, and
more of a peace-maker!&lt;/p&gt;

store like MOPAC, shortly before closing time, browsing the shelves. I
spent a long time looking at their open/closed wrench sets (like this
one I got from Home Depot) and a bunch of headgaskets, but I didn't
quite know what I wanted to buy. I stayed past closing, and they started
turning out the lights as a hint to leave, but when I got to the
checkout line, I felt bad because the only thing I'd gotten was a bundle
of zip-ties for $2.95. I had planned on paying with a couple toonies
(CAD$2 coins for you U.S. folk), but the cashier started giving me a
bunch of change like I was giving her a $50, so I had to give her a $50.
There were a lot of other people checking out, and as I was shuffling
all the bills back into my wallet, this tall guy next to me kept bumping
up against me. It made me a bit nervous, like he was going to pickpocket
me or somesuch. Anyway, I got out of there okay, and then I woke up from
my dream!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunno what all that says about me, maybe something about my
indecisiveness, or maybe just that I spend too much time working on my
car! At the least, it shows that I've been in Canada long enough to

complement to the green Douglas firs tinged yellow by the late afternoon
sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After church today, I had planned on eating lunch with a bunch of LIGHT
folk, but ended up chatting on the phone with my sister for an hour and
a half (sorry, guys!). So after a rather late lunch around 3pm, I had
the rest of the afternoon to myself. It was a lovely day just to drive,
so I meandered through downtown, across the Lion's Gate Bridge, and up
the mountains of North Vancouver, chasing the bright blue sky. As I
climbed up these steep winding residential back lanes, with expansive
views of downtown Vancouver, Stanley Park, and English Bay spread out
below me, I realized with a start that I really had no idea where I was
-- and that I didn't care; it was just so beautiful. I pulled over here
next to an empty lot, and spent a couple hours just enjoying the view,
thinking, praying, sharing with God. It's so refreshing to pray and pray
until I've said all I wanted to say to God, and then to keep praying in
the silence, listening -- for it's in that silence that God can get a
word in edgewise.&lt;/p&gt;

too big for my living room. Plus, like many IKEA things, it wasn't
particularly ... shall we say ... sturdy. Then I spotted this table
(GILLSBY, 100x60x37cm, CAD$89). It was listed as a TV stand rather than
a coffee table, but its design as a TV stand means that it's
considerably less flimsy than the coffee table designs. The tempered
glass is supposed to handle up to 165lbs; that's about as much as I
weigh! I'm quite happy with the table; I like the glass and think it
looks nice. Really not kid-safe, though....&lt;/p&gt;

us, but we'll make the most of this welcome indian summer! Today, after
helping out at Noel's fun guitar workshop, I had about half an hour to
kill before helping Steve move out of his parents' basement (and into
someone else's basement!). Occasionally, I'll go to cemeteries in the
daytime to think and pray and relax -- ha ha, it's not morbid, just
peaceful! It's amazing how quiet it is here, even in the midst of the
bustle and traffic of the city. The history is cool to read, too: this
big cross marks the Harrison family grave; seven family members are
buried here, spanning over a century from 1850 to 1952. The only other
(living) person there was a man sitting under that big tree on the
right, eating his lunch by a grave. I wasn't sure if it was the touching
scene of a widower reminiscing of sharing a meal with his young wife, or
just a random guy eating lunch...&lt;/p&gt;

to golf for me. Apparently it's called "pitch-n-putt" because the holes

comes from a terrific family. Today we celebrated their wedding in a
wonderful worship service at Fraserlands! I liked how the whole focus
was not so much on Larry+Esther as it was on God and giving glory to Him
for bringing together a devoted couple. Even the music when the bride
walked down the aisle was not the traditional Lohengrin bridal chorus,
but rather the contemporary hymn, "My Tribute" -- "to God be the glory,
for the things He has done"! The exhortation by the bride's father (and
translated entertainingly by her little brother) was really sweet, and I
also thought the foot-washing ceremony was very touching -- yeah, the

get involved in at church, as if it would define me or earn me
credentials in the eyes of the church. I will serve, but it'll be for
the right reasons, by God's calling, and not out of guilt or obligation
or even just "the need". In the meantime, the more quality time I spend
with God, the better equipped I am to encourage and reach out to
everyone I come across, building up relationships and crossing barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, this was my church sanctuary, lying on my workout bench,
with praise and worship music wafting from my car's stereo a few feet
away. The sermon was simply God's Word: I read the entire book of Hosea
and dwelt on its message of hope and undeserved compassion. We who were
rebellious and not God's people, He now calls &lt;em&gt;"Ammi":&lt;/em&gt; "my people".
We who had not received compassion, He now calls &lt;em&gt;"Ruhamah":&lt;/em&gt; "those
who have received compassion". Hosea's whole life, marriage, and family
were all one big message God used to speak to the people. His life was
very dramatic, but I have to say I hope my marriage isn't as extreme as
Hosea's! It was so refreshing, though, to sit and pray and meditate on
God's Word for two hours. Afterward I went upstairs to my guitar and
sang my heart out with hymns and praise songs of response. Now I'm ready
for corporate worship tomorrow morning!&lt;/p&gt;

many wise and mature Christian brothers and sisters that I had taken for

Rev. Paul Shen delivered a powerful and engaging series of messages on
the church's identity as the dwelling of Christ through the Holy Spirit.
I was especially struck by the reminder given in his last message in
Sunday service, of the parallel drawn in Ephesians 5 between the

study the Bible. I like her attitude towards Scripture: the deeper we
dive into the Word of God, the more it comes alive; and when we come
across a difficult or controversial passage, our response should not be
to throw up our hands and dismiss Scripture, but to dig even deeper,
reading the passage in context, so as not to misinterpret it. Here Linda
is excitedly diagramming the sentence flow of Ephesians 2:4-5.&lt;/p&gt;

Abbotsford, so I figured, hey, it can't be that much further to Mt.

famous photo spot at Picture Lake, looking across to the 9131-ft peak of
Mt. Shuksan, still snow-laden in the mist of summer. After the other

get good; it was so peaceful! The mirror-still lake, and the little
alpine trees, and the birds, and the zillions of flies and mosquitoes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of people lately have been talking with me about our church's
organization, the small-group model vs. fellowship model, and the LIGHT
young-adults ministry in particular. I think I'm starting to see a bit
of the tension and give-and-take between the capable and independent but
young and transient young adults, and the parental figure of the "old
guard" and church upper leadership. The leadership seems to be very
cautious and conservative, but also top-down and hierarchical. On the
other hand, a lot of the young adults are rather commitment-shy, and
there is a dangerous "commodity" attitude towards church -- if you don't
like one church, you can just go down the road to another one. At least,
those are my observations, but I don't know; I still have a lot more to
learn about this church. Seems you can't escape politics wherever you
go...&lt;/p&gt;
