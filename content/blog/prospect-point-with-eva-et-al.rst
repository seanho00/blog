So about a month ago, Joyce emails me from Seattle, regarding one of her
small group members who is moving up to Richmond, working for Microsoft.
Well, any friend of Joyce's is a friend of mine, and when Joyce told me
how "protective" she gets over Eva, it somehow made me more protective
of her, as well! Although I know she's quite capable of taking care of
herself, but it's still a nice feeling to kind of take someone "under my
wing," even if only for a short time and in a small way.

So finally, this weekend Eva's moving up here, together with her mom,
into a temporary rental apartment while she continues to look for a more
permanent place closer to work. The whole gang from Seattle came up to
help her settle in! We had a great time together -- a packed schedule,
but somehow still relaxed and enjoyable, everyone so comfortable with
one another. On this Labour Day, with Eva's stuff in place (only two
car-fuls), bank account set up, and enough groceries to feed a troop for
a week, we took a break to relax and do some touristy stuff -- here we
are at Prospect Point in Stanley Park, overlooking North Vancouver.

From left to right, I'm here with Jennifer, Joyce, Dennis, Eva's mom,
and Yiwei -- the only one missing is the girl of honour, Eva! She's
behind the camera.
