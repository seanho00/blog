This being the Canada Day holiday weekend, dozens of churches are having
various retreats and camps all over the area! VCAC has three -- a
Chinese family camp, Teens' Camp, and Kidz' Kamp. These lovely and
energetic teens are from \ `CCGC <http://ccgc-canada.org/>`__, with whom
I've been able to build up a relationship over the past couple years. I
thoroughly enjoyed hanging out with them at \ `last year's tent camping
trip </2006/ccgc-youth-tent-camping>`__. This year I was unable to be
their speaker, but I was still able to spend the last night overnight
with them, leading songs and sharing a little.

I'm so amazed at how resourceful Pastor Lo is: he coordinated with a
church youth group way out in Texas to have a joint retreat here in
rural BC! 37 teens from CCGC, plus 24 teens from Texas, with only 11
adults, including a few parents who came mostly to take care of the
food. I have no idea how the two churches got connected....

Here we are at the very end of the retreat, loaded on to the big yellow
school bus and ready to head home. The kids are tallying mosquito bites
like old battle scars. Look at those smiling faces; aren't they
cuuuuute??? :)

Pastor Lo posted some home videos from the camp at \ `the CCGC
PowerTeens website <http://ccgc-canada.org/powerteen/>`__.
