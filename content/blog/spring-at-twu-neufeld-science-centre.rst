Wow, what a gorgeous day! Daylight-Saving Time has come early, and with
it a few days of brilliant blue skies, a welcome respite from our
relentlessly long winter of rain, wind, and snow. This is the front door
of my building, which houses all the science departments, ranging from
math/computers/physics to biology, chemistry, environmental science, and
nursing. My office is in the back down in the basement, but I still get
a nice window view of the blue sky.
