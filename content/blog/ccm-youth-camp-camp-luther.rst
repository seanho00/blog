CCM's youth leadership camp at Camp Luther! Surrounded by water and
nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Fraser Valley in Mission, BC,
this lovely retreat centre has been serving area churches for over fifty
years. Here the kids are making their way back to the cafeteria for
lunch after some fun-filled group team-building activities at the dock.
