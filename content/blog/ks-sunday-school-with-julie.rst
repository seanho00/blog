Ay, I've been quite sparse in blogging this month! Perhaps it means I've
been less introspective/contemplative.... ;)

Today I was supposed to speak to the teens at FL, but I ended up not
being needed, so I got a rare opportunity to sit through an entire
Sunday School class at KS! Here Julie is explaining some approaches to
conflict resolution.

I looked back through my calendar, and much to my surprise I've only
been able to attend an entire KS SS class two other times this year, due
to teaching Sunday School at CCGC, preaching in Teens' Worship at VCAC,
preaching at SVPGC, and several retreats and other ministry
opportunities. I still consider VCAC my new "home base" church, and I
care very deeply about the people here, but it would be nice if it were
a bit more of a "sending" church.

Below is an excerpt from an email I sent recently asking two friends of
mine to help with worship; it touches on this topic of motivating by
encouragement rather than by guilt:

--------------

Because it is a very different mindset from the way our church works, I
want to reassert the reason why I invite you to worship along with me at
prayer meeting, and what my philosophy of ministry is:

#. God doesn't \ *need* us, but He \ *chooses* to use us despite our
   weakness.
#. It is a \ *joy* to serve Jesus, as it is He who wills and who works
   in us, not our own strength.
#. Because I've experienced this joy, I want to \ *share* it with
   others!

Here's how this philosophy plays out in the context of prayer meeting:

#. I don't "need" you to play piano/sing (hey, we don't \ *need* to sing
   any songs at prayer meeting!) -- but I choose you, value you, and
   appreciate you.
#. I personally love worshiping in music, and I love worshiping together
   as a team! It's what keeps me going, and it's in my blood! It takes
   the focus off of myself and the church's problems, and onto Christ --
   so refreshing and energizing and humbling! Same thing for prayer!
   Gets me riled up and down on my knees!
#. I love you guys, and want for you to enjoy a little bit of serving
   God in a context of freedom and joy, rather than guilt and
   obligation.

Please don't come to prayer meeting because you "have to", because
people are expecting you to, or because it's written into the membership
covenant. Please come because there is real joy and power when we are on
our knees before God, who alone can change hearts and revive our church.
Please come because our frustrations with the church (mine included) can
find release only as we cast our cares upon Jesus, when we pray together
as brothers and sisters.

| take care! It is always a pleasure to see you!
