﻿﻿These past few weeks have piled up so intensely that I still can't
believe the school year is really over today! It's taking me a little
while to transition into summer-mode. So tonight I indulged in a little
leisure reading!

So much of our modern thought process can be traced back to Plato and
Aristotle, but in the past century's postmodernity we have also flown
far from them in many ways. I loved reading about specialization of
roles within the integration inherent in the word \ *techné* (τεχνη:
encompassing skill and craft in arts, science, business, administration,
etc.). But I was also surprised at how many gaping holes in logic there
are in some of Plato's developments, especially in the various ancillary
discussions on justice, government, and education.

Here's a quote which I thought was rather sweet:

    "Is not the fairest sight of all," I asked, "for him who has eyes to
    see it, the combination in the same bodily form of beauty of
    character and looks to match and harmonize with it?""It is indeed."

    "And what is very beautiful will also be very attractive, will it
    not?"

    "Certainly."

    | "It is, then, with people of this sort that the educated man will
      fall in love; where the harmony is imperfect, he will not be
      attracted."
    |  (Plato, 'Republic', Part III, §1, 402(d))

Aww, isn't that sweet? :) Of course, he then goes on to assert that true
love ought not to have any contact with sex! \ *\*sigh\** Plato didn't
read God's design in Genesis about being "one flesh" as husband and
wife. The foolishness of God is still wiser than the wisdom of man!
