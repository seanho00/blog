A few days ago I dreamed about singing praise and worship songs together
with a small group of friends -- casual, intimate, and Spirit-led. No
program; someone would just start singing, and the rest of us would join
in on guitar, keys, or vocals. A lot of the songs were fairly upbeat and
contemporary, and also loud. We had time for one more song, which
everyone expected to also be contemporary, but what came out was the
simple melody of an old hymn. In my dream it brought tears to my eyes as
our group was brought back to the timeless truth and childlike faith of
the hymn.

When I awoke from my dream, the melody was still in my head, and I
played it to my mom on my guitar, but I couldn't remember what hymn it
was! Drove us crazy for a couple days. Finally, today my mom recalled
the title of the tune:Â \ `"Beneath the Cross of
Jesus" <http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/b/t/btcjesus.htm>`__.
