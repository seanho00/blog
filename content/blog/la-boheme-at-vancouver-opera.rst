So! For my birthday this year I treated myself to one of my favourite
operas, `"La Bohème"! <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_bohème>`__ I
booked the tickets several months in advance, but even then within my
price bracket I could only get seats way up in the nose-bleed section,
joy! Should have brought binoculars....

It was a packed house; a bit stuffy up in the balcony. I still maintain
that in the Queen Elizabeth Theatre there are no bad sightlines -- every
seat has an excellent view -- but the acoustics deteriorate a bit way up
in the cheap seats. I couldn't hear the soloists all that well
(completely unamplified), and the rustling papers and shuffling feet of
other patrons echoed off the ceiling. Next time, I'll try for the lower
seats in the balcony, just behind the dress circle, like I had for `the
Nutcracker </2006/the-nutcracker>`__.

Still, once the orchestra got going with Puccini's sensuous, lush
swells, it didn't really matter much; I lost myself in the music, so
much so that the poor girl behind me had to tap me on the shoulder to
get me to sit back in my seat! Ach, why does Puccini have to move so
quickly -- right in the first act he launches straight into the good
stuff, "Che gelida manina", Roldofo's song to Mimi, love at first sight.
Had me tearing up right away! Don't know why I'm becoming such a
hopeless romantic lately....

I think there's kind of a universal appeal to the story of "La Bohème"
-- no gods or heroes or mythical creatures here, just the story of four
everymen and their loves. But while gently poking fun at the youthful
naïveté of its protagonists, to me the music elevates their struggles
and hopes and loves to the transcendent -- universal emotions that any
audience can identify with, amplified and impassioned.

| The opera went by way too quickly; I wish I hadn't spent so much time
  reading the subtitles. There are so many scenes with multiple singers
  and counterpoint; there's a lot to track -- throughout the whole
  second act, the stage is full of players. I should have read up more
  on the libretto before going, so that I wouldn't have to read the
  subtitles -- which were atrocious, anyway! The little two-line display
  had no hope of keeping up with the duets and quartets, and the
  subtitles had to simplify so much, they made the dialogue even more
  trite than it already is. "Che gelida manina" and "Sì, mi chiamano
|  Mimì" -- Rodolfo's and Mimi's introductions to each other -- were so
  trivialized in the subtitles that the whole thing felt more like a
  19th-century episode of "Friends" than a timeless classic. I was
  pretty miffed at that!

But when I just closed my eyes and forgot about tracking the subtitles,
the music was just sublime. Puccini was unashamed in bowing a whole
section of heart-strings, even as the glockenspiel lightly danced above,
and conductor Jacques Lacombe was masterful in guiding the dynamics.
Baritone Aaron St. Clair Nicholson was particularly notable in his
powerful rendition of Marcello, but soprano Frédérique Vézina (Mimi)
really needs to tone down that annoying vibrato -- her attempts at
holding a steady note only reveal that the vibrato is just trying to
hide lacking intonation.

In keeping with tradition, I spotted a famous celebrity again at the
opera! Not a movie star this time, but the esteemed Dr. Paul Stevens
from Regent College, known for his marketplace ministry and marriage
counselling ministries! He would probably not like being called a
celebrity. :) He was there with his family, also in the cheap seats, a
few rows down from me. His left hand was all in a cast; hope it's not a
serious injury.

Well, it was a pleasant evening, quiet and peaceful ... yeah, I'm
reasonably happy, I think.
