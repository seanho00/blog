Ohhhh, I am sooo tired lately! And a bit bummed, too. I suppose the one
affects the other. Here's the little splash of colour I have in my
office, a small kalanchoe plant Sally gave me in appreciation for
speaking at BAC a couple months ago. I'm surprised the blooms have
lasted this long; this window hasn't been getting all that much light.
