My dear friends Tim and Melissa in North Carolina have always had such
pure hearts for the gospel, dedicated and straightforward in their
desire to bring the good news of Jesus Christ to the unreached and
unchurched. Tim has so faithfully persevered in his role as youth
director at the church in NC, and although he may not be getting much
treasure here on earth for it, he is storing up an abundance of treasure
in heaven by discipling and investing in the lives of those teens.

They've received a calling from God and a commissioning from Greater
Europe Mission (GEM) to pick up their family, move across the pond, and
be salt and light in a vastly under-served people group that has only a
nominal Catholic background. I am cheering them on; it's so exciting to
be following God's calling and living totally by faith in Christ!

Tonight Tim hosted a special prayer meeting at their home to cover their
new mission with prayer. I joined in by speakerphone, a continent and
three time-zones away! (Thanks to Vonage and free long-distance!) I
snapped this photo so they'd have a face to attach to the voice, but I
forgot to send it early enough.... Still, it was so nice to know that,
even across the distance and the time, our hearts are still united, in
Christ and in prayer.
