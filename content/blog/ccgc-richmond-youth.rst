Well, this was a fun weekend; I got to hang out with a bunch of
wonderful kids, both old friends and new friends! On Friday night I had
the privilege to share with the very bright and genuine youth of
Surrey \ `ECBC <http://www.ecbc.org/>`__'s True Love fellowship. I could
hardly believe their attention spans as they listened to a boring old
professor talk about science and the Bible for nearly an hour and a
half! I was so impressed with their engaging, insightful questions and
passionate desire to share the gospel with their classmates. Thanks to
Jason for extending the invitation and for working so faithfully with
the kids!

Today's photo is from this afternoon's service with the precious kids
of \ `the PowerTeens youth group <http://ccgc-canada.org/powerteen/>`__
at \ `CCGC <http://ccgc-canada.org/>`__ Richmond. Here Xiao-yi is
getting all tangled up in our "human knot" icebreaker game. There were a
lot of newcomers, especially at the Richmond church! The kids at both
Burnaby and Richmond congregations have grown since \ `last I was
here </2005/ccgchurch-in-burnaby>`__, and it was so heartwarming just to
see their adorable smiling faces! The \ `tent camping trip last
summer </2006/ccgc-youth-tent-camping>`__ was an especially precious
time building relationships with these kids. I'll get to see them again
next week!
