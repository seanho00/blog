Today was quite a full day of church events -- we celebrated the
ordination of three of our pastors, Revs. Norman, Alfred, and Joe, and
later that evening had a huge 40th anniversary thanksgiving dinner, with
about 95 tables (nearly 1000 people) at Floata Restaurant. At the
ordination, it was cool to meet folks from Franklin Gospel whose lives
had been touched by Pastor Norman's work; he also helped out at Fountain
Alliance for two years before coming to VCAC. The dinner that night was
also fun, but just a bit loud for me; I needed to take a walk to get the
ringing out of my ears.
