Here's a view of my little corner office! Corner, but it only has
windows on one side, and it's still kind of in the basement of the
building. But no complaints; the windows are nice and bright;
particularly good in the winter time! That desk chair is one that I
brought with me from NC. The threads are stripped and the screws are
falling out, but when I first moved in, Rick said that I probably had
the nicest chair in the building, better than the dean's chair! I just
have to make sure not to lean back too hard, or the back will fall
off....
