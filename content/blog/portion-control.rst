It's beautiful, sunny, and breezy today, perfect for a light brunch out
on the balcony! No fellowships or small groups or meetings today, which
means I can spend some time in the Word, preparing for upcoming retreats
and sermons -- but it also means it's kinda lonely, by myself in my
little house. Here's my masterpiece meal for this morning -- a pound of
fresh halibut fillet, pan-seared in olive oil, together with a medley of
steamed broccoli, sweet yellow bell peppers, romaine lettuce, and
hot-house tomatoes. I didn't think very hard about the portions, though,
so I cooked way too much: it was a rather filling meal for me! It would
have been enough food for two people, I think -- but there was only me
at the table today, awwww.....
