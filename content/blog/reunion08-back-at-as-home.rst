Well, the time we booked at the hotel resort is up, and my brother has
to go back to work, so we moved back to my sister's place south of
Boston. There are still three family units and four kids under one roof,
so it's still exciting and different, but somehow, being at home has a
different feel from staying at the hotel resort -- a little less like
vacation. We spent more time checking our emails and doing routine
things around the house; we didn't have a "grand adventure" to go on
today. But, I think after all the excitement over the weekend, we'd had
enough grand adventures, and everyone, both big and small, needed a bit
of rest.
