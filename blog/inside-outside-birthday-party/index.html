            <p>So, recently it was my friend Phebe's birthday, and as is apparently her
custom, every three years she throws a big shin-dig with a gazillion
guests! Last night was part one of her birthday party: dinner and
dancing at a pretty swanky lounge in Richmond; we filled up nearly the
whole place. Dinner seemed fairly formal to me; a lot of people dressed
up, or at least came in their Sunday best. It was great fun chatting
with old friends from FL that I hadn't seen in a while, and meeting new
friends from Phebe's other circles.</p>
<p>But to be honest, the party also tired me out and gave me a bit of a
headache. I didn't circulate around the tables, opting instead to hide
out in a corner and talk more in-depth with a smaller number of people.
Even so, by about 11:30pm, the noise and the heat and my own tiredness
from a long Sunday caught up with me, and I had to call it a night, for
fear that I'd fall asleep on the drive home. Maybe it's just me: like
many guys, I think, I don't do well with big dinner parties. I did enjoy
it, but I think what I enjoyed even more was the short half-hour stroll
I took beforehand, along Richmond's waterfront dikes, in the dark and
the wind and the rain.</p>
<p>I found part two of Phebe's party much more rewarding! This afternoon,
four of us took a car-load of clothes and blankets donated by folks at
last night's party, sorted them into two very full shopping carts, one
for men's clothes and one for women's clothes, and walked through parts
of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside handing them out to anyone in need. To
be outside breathing the fresh chill air, looking people square in the
eye, touching them and ministering to their needs in some small way,
meeting strong and intelligent and dignified and down-to-earth men and
women who have such a keen sense of community -- now that's fun! :)Â I'd
done street evangelism and other urban volunteer work before, but this
was my first time in Vancouver's DTES. I learned so much about this
unique community; I wished I had had more time just to listen to the
residents! I think so many of our affluent suburban enclaves are so
lonely, so suspicious of outsiders and each other -- there's actually a
lot in the DTES that we should be envious of. Thanks, Phebe!</p>
