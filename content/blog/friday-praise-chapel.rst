It's Friday, the end of the week, which means praise chapel! It's
midterm season, so it's been a rough week for all of us, students and
faculty alike. But prayer and praise are always refreshing, bringing our
focus back on Jesus, the beginning and the completion of the faith! It
was so cool to see some new faces on the worship team, full of youthful
energy and passion in worship. The gym bleachers are usually packed out
for praise chapel, 5-600 students or more, so I sneak around the back
way, that puts me right on the floor in front of the worship team. After
we were dismissed, the student standing in front of me actually stopped
me to compliment me on my voice -- awww, how sweet; to God be the glory!
