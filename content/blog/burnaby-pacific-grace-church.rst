This morning was fun; my friend Josh invited me to visit his church up
on the north side of Burnaby! I was quite impressed with Pastor Darryl
here: his passionate and down-to-earth expository preaching stayed
faithful to the Scripture but also hit very practical applications for
the congregation of mostly teens and parents. It's a funny story about
Josh: when we were both new and checking out churches, we both visited
ECBC at the same time, then coincidentally FL also! Then for a few weeks
he was at Port Moody PGMB, which I had visited earlier, too. He's
settled at Burnaby PGC for over a year now, and is transferring
membership. It's a good thing; God can use him powerfully to build up
spiritual maturity and instill a biblical mentality in the young adults
here. Over sushi lunch, we had a great time catching up and discussing
church vision; we have different perspectives -- he from humanities, I
from sciences -- but a common goal in Christ!
