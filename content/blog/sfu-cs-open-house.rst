Simon Fraser is one of the largest nearby public universities, and
probably the second-ranked computer-science / engineering school in
Canada (second to Waterloo). My colleague Alma finished her Ph.D. there
a few years ago and has been a great help in building research
connections there. Today the CS department had an open house with
presentations from many students on their current research projects. At
right here is Ghassan from the medial image analysis lab at SFU; at left
is Raeef from the electrical and computer engineering department at UBC.
It was so fun to get back into that atmosphere of researching and
solving problems with like-minded academics; it's been a while since
I've been in that scene!
