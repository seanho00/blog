            <p><a class="reference external" href="http://missionsfestvancouver.ca/">MissionsFest</a> is a huge annual
conference at Canada Place, with dozens of plenary speakers and
seminars, and hundreds of exhibitor booths. It's free admission (for
most things), so there are thousands of people; most of the seminars are
full way before they start. I ran into a ton of TWU people, several VCAC
people, and a few friends from other area churches. There were so many
exhibitor booths, just walking once through took me a couple hours! It
was nice gettting an overview of the local, national, and international
ministries represented. I realized that, although there are a few
international ministries, the networks in Canada are to a large extent
still separate from the U.S. ones that I'm familiar with.</p>
<p>I <em>still</em> don't like large crowds, so I spent quite a bit of time
outside on the Canada Place pier, bundled up in the chill air, enjoying
the views of the water, the mountains behind North Vancouver, and the
crystal blue sky. The word "calling" comes up everywhere in a conference
like this, and I think that's really the purpose of MissionsFest -- to
inspire, encourage, and equip people in the calling God has for each one
of us. While wandering through the exhibitor booths, a friend asked me,
"Have you found what you're looking for yet?" I think she was just
referring to the booths, but upon reflection, it seems the question is
apropos to the larger issue of <em>calling</em> -- have you found your
calling, the direction in which God is leading you? It's a question that
pretty much everybody faces, particularly in the young-adult years.</p>
<p>For me personally, though, the question was answered long ago: I know
without a doubt that the calling God has had on my life, from before I
was born, is after the spirit of John the Baptist, after whom I was
named. I have been reluctant to follow, because it could be a rather
lonely path. Those who don't know me well will immediately scoff and
question and try to fit me into a more "acceptable" ministry. But as I
sat on a park bench on this pier and reread Luke chapters 1-3, the
mission of John the Baptist resonated so powerfully it brought me to
tears:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their
God. It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit
and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE
CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so
as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk1:13-17&amp;version=49">(Luke 1:16-17,
NASB)</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That's exactly what I desire to do more than anything else: to prepare
the way for Jesus, to turn the hearts of the fathers back to the
children, and the hearts of the children back to the fathers <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mal4;&amp;version=49">(Malachi
4:6, the last verse of the Old
Testament)</a>.</p>
<p>But the timing and the preparation are in God's hands, and I think
patience is what He's teaching me now. I've been so impatient to become
a part of this church, but I'm starting to realize that I might never
become fully accepted/trusted here, and perhaps I just need to accept
that I might always remain an outsider, an iconoclast, a voice in the
wilderness. I wonder what John the Baptist did during all those years in
the wilderness before the word of the Lord came to him. But then I
remember that when his ministry did start, it made a powerful impact for
a few short years, like Jesus' own earthly ministry -- all in God's
timing. It seems I've forgotten already that simple one-word lesson
from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps27;&amp;version=49">Psalm
27:14</a>,
that God reminded me of <a class="reference external" href="/2006/acadia-beach-at-low-tide">less than a year
ago</a>: <strong>*WAIT*</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, John the Baptist never got married (as far as we know), and
that would really suck. Then there's the whole thing with getting
beheaded in his early thirties; yeah, here's hoping that part doesn't
apply, either!</p>
