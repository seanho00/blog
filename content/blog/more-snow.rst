Oh my, well I'm so thankful just to have made it home! The forecast was
for light flurries, a cm or two at most -- this is more like six inches!
Yeah, in the grand scheme of things it's not a lot of snow, but I really
really need to get snow tires now; my worn all-seasons are like glass on
this wet powder. I wonder how many more storms we'll get this season. I
was so thankful for our ever-humble custodians, Alan+Phyllis, who
shepherded me home, following behind me to make sure I didn't get stuck.
Their kindness reminded me of 1Cor1:4 -- "Love is kind". χρηστευομαι
(crhsteuomai, "chreis-Teu-o-mai") means "willing to help, useful" -- an
attitude of, "May I help you?". So encouraging!
