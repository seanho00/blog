More embarrassing car stories! Yeah, so with the sudden 15cm of snow we
got overnight last weekend, I learned quickly that snow and bald
all-season tires are not a good mix. So, by gracefully sliding into a
curb at Costco, real low speed, less than 20kph, I mangled my front
driver-side axle, steering knuckle, hub, control arm, bushings, lower
tie bar, rear beam and rear rotor -- the dealership quoted me $1700 in
parts, plus four hours of labour! Yipes! The car's still in the shop,
waiting on parts, so this weekend I've got this lovely rental, a 2007
Toyota Camry. The interior of the Camry is nice and big, with a luxury
feel, but it wallows like a boat in the corners and is horribly
underpowered with the 2.5L engine. It's got a tighter turning radius
than my little Sentra, though!
