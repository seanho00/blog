Today I was invited as an adjunct ("responding") speaker at a forum
organized by the Christian Social Concern Fellowship, hosted by CCM. The
primary speaker was a Chinese pastor from Toronto, Rev. Dominic Tse, but
the focus was on having compassion and being involved ("incarnate," to
use a word that I feel is often abused) in the local Canadian community.
We had a small, cozy group of about 20 English-speaking Chinese, teens
and adults.

It was kind of an interesting experience for me, participating in a kind
of ministry that I don't often have direct interaction with, broadening
my horizons a bit. It also was an odd feeling for me when they always
insisted on addressing me as "Dr. Ho". :)Â I had a great conversation
over dinner with Brian Roodnick from West Point Grey Academy; it was
delightful to gather insight from an experienced fellow teacher.
