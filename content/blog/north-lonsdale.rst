*123°04'41"W by 49°21'02"N*

The sky is just so beautiful today, deep blue and cloudless, a perfect
complement to the green Douglas firs tinged yellow by the late afternoon
sun.

After church today, I had planned on eating lunch with a bunch of LIGHT
folk, but ended up chatting on the phone with my sister for an hour and
a half (sorry, guys!). So after a rather late lunch around 3pm, I had
the rest of the afternoon to myself. It was a lovely day just to drive,
so I meandered through downtown, across the Lion's Gate Bridge, and up
the mountains of North Vancouver, chasing the bright blue sky. As I
climbed up these steep winding residential back lanes, with expansive
views of downtown Vancouver, Stanley Park, and English Bay spread out
below me, I realized with a start that I really had no idea where I was
-- and that I didn't care; it was just so beautiful. I pulled over here
next to an empty lot, and spent a couple hours just enjoying the view,
thinking, praying, sharing with God. It's so refreshing to pray and pray
until I've said all I wanted to say to God, and then to keep praying in
the silence, listening -- for it's in that silence that God can get a
word in edgewise.

*Postscript:* I did find my way home afterward; thank God for GPS!
