Apologies, it seems like I've only been updating on the weekends! My
workweek isn't spectacularly blog-worthy, mostly just lecture
preparation, me staring at the computer!

This weekend was nice, though, as I got to hang out with
the \ `Fraserlands <http://vcac.bc.ca/>`__ Mandarin young-adult "Seed"
fellowship: really cool guys and girls there, with such fervent hearts
for the Lord! Since Valentine's Day was last week, they asked me to come
to their Friday night fellowship to speak on love. Yipes, that's a topic
I sure feel underqualified to speak on! But Scripture does have so much
to teach us all about love, so I took them through \ `1 John
4 <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;&search=1Jn4:7-21>`__, \ `1
Corinthians
13 <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;&search=1Cor12:31-13:13>`__, \ `Colossians
3:12-19 <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;&search=Col3:12-19>`__,
and even a bit of \ `Song of
Songs <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=49;&search=SS1:1-3>`__
-- in hopes that the more they heard of God's Word, the less they'd have
to listen to my word!

We had a great time together, and they are just so welcoming! It's so
refreshing to be greeted with, "I'm glad to see you!", rather than,
"What are you doing here?". They invited my mom and I to their Chinese
New Year lunch and celebration today after church; here Monica is all
dressed up in her traditional headdress and whatnot, singing in this
wicked cool traditional Chinese style, lilting notes and spoken asides
and everything. All we needed was an er-hu to complete the picture!
