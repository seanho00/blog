Jon's small group is planning a retreat on Bowen Island over Easter
weekend, and he's asked me to help out a bit, so the three of us went to
scout it out today. It's only 20mins away by ferry, yet so far from the
stress and traffic. The Rivendell retreat centre is space to breathe, a
place to silence the cacophony and tune our hearts to hear the still
small voice of the Lord. The encircling mountains, lush green valleys,
cloud and water, are all so wistfully breathtaking -- but then I
remembered that the tabernacle of the Lord is in my heart, in humility,
and obedience, and quietness before Him, wherever I am, whether here in
Rivendell, orÂ \ `in my garage </2006/worship-service-in-the-garage>`__,
or in my regular daily devotions.

    | Cease striving and know that I am God;
    |  I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the
      earth.
    |  -- Psalm 46:10 (NASB)
