Tonight my four-year-old niece QQ has a lovely little ballet
performance, a rendition of Cinderella (with considerable artistic
license to include roles for lots of little flowers and butterflies and
kittens and such!). Here are my nephew Ian and my sister and
brother-in-law, as we wait in line outside in the comfortable late
afternoon sun.
