ï»¿Yep, Libby's a world-famous concert pianist; she's got groupies
(students) and everything! Tonight she and two other faculty members at
the Vancouver Academy of Music put on a terrific premiere concert as the
Vanier Trio -- piano, violin, cello. The VAM is right across the Burrard
Inlet from downtown Vancouver, in the waterfront Vanier Park, right next
to the planetarium. The Koerner Recital Hall is an intimate environment,
seating only 289 in a long narrow arrangement, a perfect setting for a
small recital intended for VAM students, family, and friends. I liked
how the faculty explained a bit of the backstory behind each piece
before performing it. The largo movement of Beethoven's "Ghost" trio was
probably my favourite!
