Yep, for our big outing tonight we all went out to a local family buffet
restaurant! This is just half of our family, my parents and the two of
us West-Coast siblings -- the East-Coast siblings will have their own
get-together for Christmas. My mom's behind the camera. The last time we
were able to have a full reunion was summer 2006 -- reunions are
complicated affairs nowadays, with the six of us, three in-laws, and six
nephews/nieces!
