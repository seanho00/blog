            <p>Yeah, I remember how tough it was to find housing in a new unfamiliar
area -- I'm still indebted to Dan for finding me my cozy little Finley
Forest condo in North Carolina! So I'm more than happy to be a bit of
Eva's eyes and ears in Richmond. The landlady at this place was a kindly
middle-aged Hong Kong lady; she was quite happy to speak Mandarin with
me (ah, my Cantonese is severely lacking), and quite eager to get a
quiet single Taiwanese lady for a tenant. The inside of this shower
looked pretty awful, though, lots of mould in the lower corners,
indicative of poor drainage. And the kitchenette was abysmal.</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p>Today was a pretty packed and tiring day for me; at this point in the
day I hadn't had time to eat anything yet, except for a couple cookies
from the faculty meeting! I notice that I start forgetting little things
more when I don't eat or sleep enough. .... umm, what was I saying
earlier? ;)</p>
<p>In any case, I am so grateful to God for every breath, and for the fact
that I do have food available (if only I take time to eat it!). This
morning, during a break in that three-hour faculty meeting, a colleague
of mine whom I respect dearly, and who is usually so strong and brash,
really surprised me. Right in the middle of the crowded, noisy hallway,
she kinda broke down in front of me, sharing tearfully about her
stresses at home at and work. My heart goes out to her, but I really had
no idea what to say -- and she probably didn't need me to say anything
at all. But I pray for her, for God's peace and strength, and I am
reminded that there are so many who have gone through so much pain; I
hope I can be a small glimmer of a reflection of the love and compassion
that comes from Jesus Christ.</p>
