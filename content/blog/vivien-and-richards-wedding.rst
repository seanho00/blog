Aww, 'tis the season for weddings! And for me, 'tis the age when every
year a lot of my friends all get married up! Today it was Vivien and
Richard from KS. They are such a sweet, quiet couple; I always see them
hiding out in the balcony at KS, holding hands. They're always pleasant
and peaceable, soft-spoken and never ones to draw attention to
themselves.

Today's ceremony at Fraser Lands, officiated by Pastor Lawrence, was
sparse and simple, which I thought kind of reflected their aversion to
pomp and ceremony. It was fairly small, less than 200 people I think; I
would have thought more people from church would be there. In this photo

aisle, she had thisÂ \ *huge* grin on her face, it was fantastically
hilarious! :)
