Mmm... well, I'm feeling upbeat today; the past couple of weeks have
been quite encouraging and hopeful at church! This morning's message by
Dr. George Durance at our lay leaders' "retreat" emphasized the
importance ofÂ \ *rest* as a spiritual discipline -- and how hard it is
to do when our churches' culture is so often focused on "DO" rather than
"BE". Dr. Durance mentioned seven different ways in which people of
different personalities can rest. Two of the ones I remembered are
"relational rest" and "contemplative rest". After the seminar a bunch of
LIGHT folks (and a couple of us non-LIGHT young adults) went out for
sushi and had rather enjoyable conversations on everything from
euthanasia to Ginny's cat-that-wasn't-her-cat. I found it to be
wonderful "relational rest" for a Saturday afternoon!

With three hours left to kill before my dinner appointment, I took a
stroll around Station Square until I found myself here on a lonely park
bench nearby the Burnaby Public Library. In quiet contemplative rest I
simply sat and watched these cute little Mandarin-speaking kids play in
the snow. One five-year-old boy was just walking around eating random
chunks of snow! So cute... I also had an encouraging chat with a random
brother in Christ who stopped by, Lowell from Willingdon church. Lowell
had felt a calling to evangelism a year ago, and has been approaching
random strangers to share the gospel with them!

In the chill of the slanting winter sun, as I prayed, my heart was
quieted by the knowledge of God's love. My prayer once again to God is
that He prepare and equip me to be the very most Godly and devoted
husband and father that I can be, according to His calling and His
incomparable power working within me.
