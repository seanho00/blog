Today's the last day of classes at TWU, and wow has it ever felt like a
long semester! I think the unusual weather and long winter really made
it feel like it was dragging on. The student life folks make sure that
each semester ends off on a jubilant note, though -- with praise chapel!
Several of the student-led praise teams joined together; there was so
much energy and enthusiasm in the gym! We still have final exams ahead
of us -- stressful times for students and teachers alike -- but praise
chapel reminds us that through it all, God will be magnified!
