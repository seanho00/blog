            <p>I've always enjoyed Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker"; I remember listening to
it in the car on the way to elementary school. The music is stirring and
syncopated; beautiful and so characteristically Russian. Today I
attended a matinee showing at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/theatres/qet/qet.html">the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in
Vancouver</a>,
presented by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.balletbc.com/">Ballet BC</a> and the Alberta
Ballet, together with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vancouversymphony.ca/">VSO</a>.
Every time I listen through the entire ballet, I feel like the famous
parts are all so short and crowded in the second act. The first act is
mostly narrative; it's the ethereal fantasy of the second act that gets
the imagination going. But the second act finishes so quickly; I want
each segment to be at least twice as long!</p>
<p>It's interesting to compare how different choreographers interpret the
classic story. The last time I saw <a class="reference external" href="http://pnb.org/">the Pacific NW
Ballet</a> perform <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnb.org/season/nutcracker/">the
Nutcracker</a> was about ten
years ago; I'd like to go back again to see Maurice Sendak's fantastical
artwork and set design. In North Carolina, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.carolinaballet.com/">Carolina Ballet
production</a> was quite kid-friendly:
the dancers did a good job, particularly in the first act, of playfully
and whimsically involving the audience.</p>
<p>I liked the production here in Vancouver; I thought the choice of having
the entire second act happen in the royal court simplified set design
somewhat. I've seen other interpretations where each dance (Spaniards,
Arabians, Chinese, etc.) is set in a different location, and the swan
boat flies Clara and the Nutcracker Prince to each place. I have to say,
though, I really disagree with their interpretation of the Arabian
dance: there was just far too much activity and flailing around. The
Arabians are supposed to be seductive and enchanting, with slow and
deliberate, meaningful movements -- that's what the music is saying!</p>
<p>All in all, it was quite enjoyable, and I would see it again next year.
The Queen Elizabeth Theatre is a terrific venue with wonderful
sightlines -- I arrived late and was seated in the way back of the
mezzanine for the first act, but even back in the "cheap seats" the view
was great, and if anything the rustling of seats and papers was a little
more muffled in the mezzanine than it was in the balcony. I sat in my
original seat for the second act; it was in the "nicer" part of the
balcony, and I even saw Canadian actors Michael+Susan Hogan and their
kids, seated just in front of me in the dress circle (Mr. Hogan
plays <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/cast/tigh/">Colonel Saul
Tigh</a> on the new
"Battlestar Galactica", among other roles).</p>
<p>It's rare that I make the trip out to downtown Vancouver, so as I drove
home, I was struck again by the sharp contrast between the glossy,
expensive high-rise condos and the very destitute people on E. Hastings.
At a stop light by a senior's centre on the Upper East Side, I could see
despair in the eyes of the people inside, mostly Asians. I wonder if we
could bring the church kids there, to bring a little light and song and
the gospel of Jesus Christ to them.</p>
