Poor Steve is moving again, back to his parents' place, from one
basement to another. Another friend Gary (with a pickup truck) and I
swung over to help him with the heavy lifting. Steve really doesn't have
that much stuff; I've helped friends move a lot more stuff from tiny
600sqft apartments! We couldn't have moved that couch without the pickup
truck, though! I had a good laugh when even Steve's own mom agreed with
us that he never throws anything away, what a packrat! :)
