ï»¿Bob organized a big group to go white-water rafting on the Thompson
River in the scenic mountains of southern BC! Hyak Rafting offers
paddle-rafting (where you get to do the paddling yourself), but we opted
for the powerboat ride, where we have a guide who drives a 16-person
raft with a powerful four-stroke motor. The powerboat is able to go
through bigger rapids, and we didn't have to do any strenuous work, just
hold on for the ride! That's good for us non-swimmers! I think everyone
had a good time, and it was good fun getting to know folks from Bob's
other social circles!
