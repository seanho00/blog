Here's just a quick snapshot from my daily commute, out here in the
beautiful Fraser Valley! I forgot to pack a lunch today, but I only live
ten minutes away from work, so I had time to come home for a quick
lunch. On my way back to the office, as I crested the top of the hill in
Langley by 72nd St, the bright sunlight and crisp clear blue skies were
just so amazing, I just had to stop for a few seconds and admire the
view out my car window. This family has lots of small farm animals:
chickens, sheep, llamas I think, too. It kind of looked like the goats
were scratching themselves against that post; I have no idea why.
