Seed fellowship is the Mandarin-speaking young adults group at
Fraserlands; kind of like the counterpart to LIGHT. They have such warm
and welcoming hearts; it is a marvel to behold! I've spoken at their
fellowship before andÂ \ `hung out with them at service and special
events </2007/mandarin-cny-at-fraserlands>`__; they have such a thirst
for God's Word. Just listening to their choir singing, it brings tears
to my eyes -- they sing like they really mean it! Not just mouthing the
words because we "have to", because it's what a liturgical worship
service "ought" to have. So refreshing!
