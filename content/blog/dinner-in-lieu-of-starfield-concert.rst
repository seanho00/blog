Our TGIF young-adults' small group had been looking forward to \ `the
big Starfield concert <http://www.starfieldonline.com/>`__ at Willingdon
Church today, but our plans got derailed!

At Starfield's concert the previous night in Abbotsford at Central
Heights MB Church, there was a terrible \ `incident wherein the
sanctuary floor
collapsed <http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article682222.ece>`__
under hundreds of kids! Thankfully, nobody perished; there were numerous
minor injuries but only two major injuries. God was certainly protecting
them! The insurance investigators and city engineers are continuing to
look at the building to see what exactly happened, but I blame it on
these kids nowadays and their "pogoing", jumping up and down in time to
the music.

|  These young-'uns and their newfangled jumping, why when I was their
  age, we lifted our hands and were happy with that!

So our concert tonight got cancelled, but still we wanted to get
together as a small group ... we can still pray for those who were
involved in the incident. We met at Anducci's in Guilford (thanks Sunny
for the great recommendation!) and had a nice meal, even though it was
only the three of us, followed by a pleasant walk out by Fort Langley.
