Today is TWU's Community Day, marking the start of the new working year
for staff and faculty at Trinity. It's a time when we get back together
after a summer of working on our own separate projects; some faculty
have been away on travel studies, or sabbatical, or just doing their own
research. Sessional faculty only work 9 months out of the year, so it's
their time to come back on campus. For me, my summer has been
full-up-to-the-brim with the ministry work -- I'm kind of looking
forward to the school year for a reprieve! :) Well, maybe it won't be
less hectic, but at least it's a bit more predictable....

Community Day is always cool because it's essentially a worship service
for all the staff/faculty, all five or six hundred of us. This year, we
borrowed the sanctuary at Langley Christian Reformed Church; it was just
beautiful and really set me in a worshipful mood. Even the upward sweep
of the big pipe organ seemed to uplift our spirits in reverence. I came
in late and had to stand in the balcony stairwell, but still I
thoroughly enjoyed the time of worship.
