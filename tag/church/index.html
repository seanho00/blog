	    <p class="post-summary"><p>Today was a good day. I stopped worrying about what areas of ministry to

credentials in the eyes of the church. I will serve, but it'll be for
the right reasons, by God's calling ...</p></p>

	    <p class="post-summary"><p>English Sunday school at Fraserlands tends not to be terribly
well-attended, mostly because it's at 9:15am rather than 11am as it is
at the Knight St. campus. The class in the Fireside room has a pretty
broad range of people, from community college students on up to parents ...</p></p>
