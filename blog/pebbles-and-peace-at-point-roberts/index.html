<p>What an odd feeling -- today feels like a real Sabbath! I know I've been
wearing myself thin lately, doing way too much; it's not sustainable
long-term. Teaching at TWU is enjoyable and provides some nice
stability, but the church ministries are where my heart's really at --
and the opportunities have really skyrocketed the past couple years. I
have, though, been trying to block out my Saturdays to be a Sabbath
rest: some time to think and pray and really wait upon the Lord.</p>
<p>This morning's <a class="reference external" href="http://photo.seanho.com/2008-04_ACTS_Grad/">ACTS commencement
ceremony</a> at South Delta
Baptist was really truly restful for me -- and not just because I didn't
have any responsibilities! (Next Saturday will be TWU's commencement;
that's when I'll have to wear my floofy hat and sit on stage.) The
atmosphere at the ACTS graduation was relaxed, steady, and worshipful. I
spread out across a couple pews in the sparsely-populated balcony and
enjoyed the soft worship music, while admiring the view out a wall of
40-foot-tall windows to a stand of Douglas Firs, and the amber fields
beyond. It was such a blessing to be there and cheer on friends; they
are both prepared and called to God's work.</p>
<p>The church is pretty far away from home, but quite close to the border
with Point Roberts. I'd never been there, so after the ceremony, I
decided to swing south just to check things out. Point Roberts is a
peculiar little promontory on the Tsawwassen Peninsula, the tip of which
juts south of the 49th parallel, the boundary between Canada and the
U.S. There is no land connection from Point Roberts to the rest of
Washington State without going through Canada, although there are
ferries across Boundary Bay. The whole enclave is less than five square
miles in area, but it has a thriving industry of mailboxes and gas
stations for Canadian residents wishing to take advantage of good
exchange rates. There's even a NEXUS lane here (unlike at my nearest
crossing, in Lynden/Aldergrove), so my border crossing today was quick
and hassle-free.</p>
<p>Here on this rocky beach it's windy and chilly; the surf pounds and
smooths the stones at my feet. I stand on a large rock at the threshold
of the water, at the very tip of the peninsula, and face forward into
the wind, watching the clouds swirl past the sun. On the surface of the
waves, a small flock of loons bobs aimlessly, huddling together for
protection. Not far away, a small log of driftwood pokes up through the
surface of the water briefly, then disappears. Its motion seems a bit
more purposeful than mere driftwood, though. Suddenly, the loons
disperse and take to the sky, and in a moment I see the reason why: the
small log pokes up again; it is the snout of a sea lion, less than 30
feet away from me.</p>
<p>My time here today is a little less than my usual walks on the beach; I
need to get back. I still have many, many things I need to do; indeed,
many things past-due: marking and teaching, preaching and praying,
retreats and Sunday services, programs and people and relationships. But
today, this Sabbath day, my heart is kept in the peace of Christ.</p>
