Oof, the semester is nearly over, and just about everyone is running out
of steam, myself included. The other day a colleague and friend stopped
by just to see how I was doing; that was so sweet of her. She said that
just from my shoulders she could tell that I had a lot on my mind and
was carrying a lot alone, and I suppose that's true.

Today, I couldn't really afford the time, but I really really needed at
least to take a walk outside for a bit, so I strolled for five minutes
through our new native plant garden out back behind our building's
parking lot. The springy feel of the soil-and-bark walkway was so soft
on my feet. Here is a lovely\ *Trillium ovatum* blossom: apparently,
they depend on ants attracted to their oil to spread seeds for them.
