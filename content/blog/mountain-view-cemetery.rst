Wow, what a gorgeous day! We know full well that autumn is nearly upon
us, but we'll make the most of this welcome indian summer! Today, after
helping out at Noel's fun guitar workshop, I had about half an hour to
kill before helping Steve move out of his parents' basement (and into
someone else's basement!). Occasionally, I'll go to cemeteries in the
daytime to think and pray and relax -- ha ha, it's not morbid, just
peaceful! It's amazing how quiet it is here, even in the midst of the
bustle and traffic of the city. The history is cool to read, too: this
big cross marks the Harrison family grave; seven family members are
buried here, spanning over a century from 1850 to 1952. The only other
(living) person there was a man sitting under that big tree on the
right, eating his lunch by a grave. I wasn't sure if it was the touching
scene of a widower reminiscing of sharing a meal with his young wife, or
just a random guy eating lunch...
