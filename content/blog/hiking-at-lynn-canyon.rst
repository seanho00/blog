Yay, so for our small group activity this month we took a trip out to
Lynn Canyon in North Vancouver, walked across the suspension bridge,
climbed a big rock, enjoyed the quiet cedar forests, and overall had a
wonderful time of fellowship together! The previous night, I had gotten
about three hours of sleep, staying up late chatting with Tony, and
preparing songs and a sermon for Teens' Worship. So although the hike
was not terribly strenuous physically, but I was just so sleepy! I don't
actually recall much of what we did specifically; it's all kind of a
blur -- but I remember the pleasant feeling of being at peace amongst
friends!
