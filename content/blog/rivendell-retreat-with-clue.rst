Wow, I had such a wonderful time this weekend with Jon's small group
"CLUE", up at the lovely sacred retreat centre of \ `Rivendell on Bowen
Island </2007/rivendell-with-jon-and-elaine>`__! We all were able to
spend time with each other and spend time in awe of God's faithfulness
and majesty. What struck me most about the weekend was the concept
of \ *time* -- when we arrived, the hostess quoted a line from the
Fellowship of the Ring: "Time doesn't seem to pass here: it just is."
Throughout most of the retreat, the hands of the clock seemed to
disappear from our consciousnesses; we worried less about \ *chronos*,
and simply moved from one \ *kairos* event to another, together as a
group. What an utterly otherworldly feeling! The final day, of course,
the clock started again, as we frantically hurried to clean up and make
the 12:35 ferry. Oh, and we left a man behind, too! He did make it back
later, under his own power!
