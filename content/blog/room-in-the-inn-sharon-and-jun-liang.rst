I've known Jun-Liang since I was eight years old; my father took him
under his wing and was a mentor to him, and he became a part of our
family. He's also, far and away, the best truly world-class violinist I
have ever had the privilege to hear in-person. He+Sharon have been
pillars in the church in Seattle, ECC, serving faithfully for many
years.

This weekend they led a marriage enrichment retreat out in Sumas, WA, so
after the retreat they swung up north of the border to come and visit
Eva and me! It was such a joy to see them and host them at my place,
even just for the night. My parents had often taken in Jun-Liang when he
was younger, so I considered it an honour to "continue the legacy" of
hospitality in a small way! They also are continuing the legacy of
mentorship, by mentoring a number of young-adults in the Mandarin
congregation at ECC -- including Eva when she was in Seattle. It was
good to see Eva again: even though we nominally attend the same church,
we rarely cross paths!
