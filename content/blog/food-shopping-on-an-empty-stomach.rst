Normally I just go down the street to the Save-On Foods for grocery
shopping, but today I had a bit of extra time, so I made a trip out to
the T&T oriental market in Surrey! Ohhh, so much yummy food, the folks
who've lived here long don't know how good they have it here!
Fresh-baked coffee bread, taro buns, BBQ pork buns, Taiwanese pineapple
bread, durian, rambutan, longyan, bok choy of all sorts, beautiful and
cheap Asian pears, live geoduck, clams, crabs -- and even, shown here,
ba-kut-eh stew mix! (made in Canada by a Singaporean company.) I haven't
had ba-kut-eh since my last trip to Malaysia so long ago. So much
yumminess; people looked at me funny as I walked around with this huge
grin on my face the whole time!
