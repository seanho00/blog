Whew, things these days have been craaaazy hectic! We're smack-dab in
the middle of finals, the stack of papers-left-to-mark is getting
taller, and my weekends are still wall-to-wall. I've realized that
during the summer I'll be preaching an average of 12 times a month!

Today, I'm rushing out the door just after teaching Sunday school at
CCGC and just before zipping off to lunch before Sunday school at S-ECBC
-- and then I stop, captivated by the brilliantly saturated colours of
this small tulip-and-bluebell garden behind the Edmonds Community
Centre. What glorious beauty, reflecting the beauty of our Creator!
