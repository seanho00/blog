            <p>I had so much fun at the CBBC retreat this weekend! The kids were
hilarious and surprising and heartwarming and precious, and the
partnership and coworking with Pastor Dave went so smoothly -- we "tag
teamed" really well.</p>
<p>Ach, but there is a hidden cost to all these retreats -- the travel!
Hanging out with the kids and speaking God's truth into their lives is
so energizing and rewarding, but the <em>travel</em> -- ohh, that's tiring!</p>
<p>So today, after sitting in the San Jose airport for five hours while
waiting for our inbound plane to arrive after a mechanical problem, we
finally got on our flight to Seattle, arriving past 1am. Of course, at
that time, there weren't any connecting flights up to Vancouver, so I
was stuck in Seattle, in the middle of the night. But I needed to get to
Langley by 9am the next morning for work, so I did what any crazy
traveler would do -- I rented a car and drove myself up, airport to
airport, from 2am until about 4:30am! At least I didn't have to worry
about traffic at that hour!</p>
<p>This photo was taken somewhere outside of Bellingham -- yes, it was kind
of hard to drive at 120kph while looking through the viewfinder and
trying to hold the camera steady for 1/6th of a second in the dark! I
noticed an interesting thing about myself when I'm really tired: I could
accomplish various autonomic functions without difficulty -- driving,
watching for potholes, crossing the border, even pulling out the correct
drivers' license when I got pulled over (it was just a warning). But the
higher-order, executive functions of my brain just shut down --
somewhere around Redmond, I came to and wondered, "hey, which state am I
in? For that matter, which <em>country</em> am I in?". :)</p>
<p>Finally, after dropping off the rental car and picking up my own car
from YVR parking, I drove another hour home to Langley, collapsing in
bed around 5:30am. Enough time for a quick nap before getting up at 7:30
for work!</p>
